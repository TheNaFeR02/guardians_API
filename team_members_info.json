the monarch of Atlantis, the undersea home of his semi-humanoid race. While the true origins of his race are unknown, Aquarus and his queen ruled the undersea kingdom for many year both during times of dynamic and tumultuous eras. With their aid, their people developed matter transportation technology that allowed them to vanquish Depth Dwellers and establish contact with the surface world. Eventually, he joined the Guardians of the Globe as a peace keeper and a representative for his people as he served with his fellow heroes.

Atlantean custom demanded that they be wed since Invincible's father had killed Aquarus. The marriage never took place and a new Aquarus was chosen known as Lethan.</p><p>Lethan served as Aquarus without the warrior tone of his predecessor until the Octoboss tried to take over Atlantis. Using some tricks, the Guardians of the Globe were able to keep Lethan in power as monarch and has since kept a large distance from his in-hap hero.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Aquarus could breathe easily underwater, as it was his natural habitat. He could also go on land without any breathing (or any other life-threatening difficulties), and was inferred to be skilled in some forms of weaponry, as he wielded a Trident.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105537/", "id": 105537, "name": null, "issue_number": "7"}, "gender": 1, "id": 41125, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/111746/5904062-72_16%20%281%29.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-506222/", "id": 506222, "name": "Reboot?

The scientist in charge was ashamed of what he had done so he traded the child with the dead child of another family. Eve went to live with the Wilkins and they named her Samantha Eve Wilkins. In school she was considered a science prodigy since she already knew everything about any science that anyone could teach her, which turned out to be an early manifestation of her powers. Before becoming a hero she was warned by the mysterious scientist who had helped to create her not to ever use her powers, for they could lead to her downfall. She goes on to defy this warning, realizing that she has the power to change the world for the better and joins the <a href=\"/teen-team/4060-41090/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41090\">Teen Team</a>, a group of after school super heroes.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Meeting Invincible</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/857606-invincible_eve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-857606\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5771484375\" data-width=\"1024\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:157.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/857606-invincible_eve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-857606\"><img alt=\"Eve coming to Invincible for a shoulder to cry on\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26503/857606-invincible_eve.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/857606-invincible_eve.jpg 1024w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/2/26503/857606-invincible_eve.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/857606-invincible_eve.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26503/857606-invincible_eve.jpg 405w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" data-width=\"405\"></a><figcaption>Eve coming to Invincible for a shoulder to cry on</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a> first runs across Atom Eve she is with the rest of the Teen Team as they try to stop a robbery of a shipment of video game systems by the <a href=\"/mauler-twins/4005-41202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41202\">Mauler</a> twins. Shortly afterwards Mark and Eve learn that the two of them actually share a Physics class and had the same lunch period. He asks her if she wants to go out on patrol, which she thinks is a pass at her and she tells him that she's in a relationship with <a href=\"/rex-splode/4005-41137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41137\">Rex-Splode</a>. He tells her that she misunderstood him, and that he actually just wanted to go on patrol. She shows him a good place to take off and change into their costumes, and when he asks her if people will see them, she teaches him one of his most important lessons, that he'd be surprised how rarely people actually look up.</p><p>She continues her relationship with Rex-Splode until she learns that he has been cheating with her on <a href=\"/dupli-kate/4005-41136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41136\">Dupli-Kate</a>, her fellow Teen Team member. Not knowing where else to go she went to Mark and said that she didn't know anyone else to turn to right now, simply because outside of the Teen Team she didn't really have any friends. This was the first sign that something deeper might form between the two of them. She did begin to develop strong feelings for Mark but didn't realize it till after he was dating a girl from his school named <a href=\"/amber-bennett/4005-41127/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41127\">Amber</a>. She tried to move on and began dating Mark's friend, <a href=\"/william-clockwell/4005-41131/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41131\">William Clockwell</a>. The relationship didn't last long, as it seemed that he was more in love with her powers and the fact that he had a super hero for a girlfriend than he was with her.</p><h3>Moving to Africa</h3><p>Ever since she was a child she wanted to use her powers for good but she always assumed that being a superhero was the best way to accomplish this. However after all that had happened to her she realized that being a superhero just wasn't for her. So she moved to Africa where she began using her powers to help those who really needed it. The only time that she puts her costume back on is when Invincible is away and the entire world is threatened by <a href=\"/omnipotus/4005-55178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55178\">Omnipotus</a>, inwhich she joins forces with every other hero imaginable to face him. After his defeat and after Mark returns to Earth, she decides to show Invincible how well things are going for her she invites him and his girlfriend Amber to come out and stay with her for a few days. While out there Eve subtly tries to convince Mark that Amber is wrong for him, saying that he just can't date normal people, but he tells her that she's wrong and that Amber is different from normal people. However he never detects that the reason why she's telling him this is because she actually loves him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/164077-67589-invincible.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-164077\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.56\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:156.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/308/164077-67589-invincible.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-164077\"><img alt=\"Mark and Eve finally kiss\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/164077-67589-invincible.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/164077-67589-invincible.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mark and Eve finally kiss\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/164077-67589-invincible.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/164077-67589-invincible.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mark and Eve finally kiss</figcaption></figure><p>Mark then battles Angstrom Levy who sucks him into one alternate dimension after another, trying to tire him out. He finally kills Levy but now discovers that he's trapped in a dimension that is an empty wasteland. He realizes he's never going to get back home, when he is suddenly visited by The <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">Guardians of the Globe</a> from an alternate future. They tell Mark that they've come back in time to return him home, but the future Atom Eve tells Mark that she always loved him, and that it was her greatest regret never letting him know. Mark is stunned to learn this so he tries to think about what he should do, if he really has feelings for her. He goes to Africa, hoping that seeing her will make things straighten out, but the moment he sees her the two of them kiss.</p><h3>Lead up to the Invincible War</h3><p>Feeling guilty over this, Mark breaks up with Amber and then tells Eve about what her future self said, which only upsets her so much that she leaves. Eventually, <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Mark</a> finds her, although she made it difficult for him to do so. <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Mark</a> wishes to talk to Eve about their last conversation, but she tells him that she is not in the mood to do so. However \"work\" keeps putting the two of them together whether they like it or not. When the <a href=\"/sequids/4060-55695/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55695\">Sequids</a> begin to take over the planet of Mars and the astronauts stationed there, Mark and Eve have to help the Guardians of the Globe as they travel up there to free the Martians and save the humans. Eve is able to provide the team with barriers that keep them from being taken over until Robot has finished his device to destroy the Sequids, however Eve passes out right before he is done. When she comes too Invincible has saved the day and they are on a ship back to Earth, but she still doesn't want to talk about what has happened.</p><p>Soon after Mark tracks her down in Africa again but just as he does they receive another emergency distress signal from <a href=\"/cecil/4005-42576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42576\">Cecil</a> regarding the fact that all of the heroes have disappeared, and that he needs <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Mark</a> back in the United States immediately. Eve decides to accompany <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Mark</a> on this particular mission. While in flight, <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Mark</a> tries to, again, talk about things between the two individuals. However, Eve tells him that she has no desire to talk about things at that time. When they arrive at the specified location, Eve uses her powers to drill three miles underground to where the heroes are being held by <a href=\"/doc-seismic/4005-54718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54718\">Doc Seismic</a>. The two begin fighting <a href=\"/doc-seismic/4005-54718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54718\">Doc Seismic</a> and the creatures under his control, but Eve is, eventually, knocked unconscious by a giant worm-like creature. As she falls, she is caught by <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Mark</a>, who is then blindsided, dropping Eve.

She leaves the hospital, still in bandages, and shows up to help Mark who is almost beaten to death at this point. Conquest beats Eve with ease and it appears as if she's dead, causing Mark to launch out in rage, which even then he isn't able to defeat Conquest. However, Eve is not dead, ever since she was born she had a limit placed on her powers where she couldn't affect organic tissue, but by being this close to death the limiter has been released. Her powers kick in and completely regenerate and rebuild her body and she attacks Conquest with her new powers that allow her to sear the skin off his body. Invincible is able to use this opening to finish Conquest off and the both of them pass out soon afterwards, just as the rest of Earth's heroes show up in time to help.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1038602\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1454352441614\" data-width=\"942\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 942px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1038602\"><img alt=\"Eve finds out she's pregnant.\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" data-width=\"558\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg 942w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg 558w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eve finds out she's pregnant.\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg 942w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/2/26503/1038602-eve.jpg 558w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" data-width=\"558\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eve finds out she's pregnant.</figcaption></figure><p>Mark wakes up recovering in Cecil's labs with Eve there next to him. She explains to him about how she rebuilt her entire body with her powers, which Mark comments on how she rebuilt herself a little differently, pointing out that her breast were now larger, which she just says must have been done subconsciously. Mark's brother Oliver is skeptical of this when he hears it, saying how hard it is to rebuild yourself atom by atom. He apparently wasn't wrong to say this as her powers begin to act up, leaving strange energy behind or causing flowers to grow where she sleeps. Shortly after this and a romantic trysts between the two young lovers, Mark is talking to Eve behind a bathroom door where she seems distracted. Unknown to Mark, she has just learned that she is pregnant.</p><h3><a href=\"/the-viltrumite-war/4045-56234/\" data-ref-id=\"4045-56234\">The Viltrumite War</a></h3><p>Mark is needed by his father to go into space, because it is now time for what he has been training, to face off against the Viltrumite warriors. Even has been wondering how to break the news to Mark that she's pregnant, but she knows this is not the time to do that when he's about to travel into space to face his greatest threat. Mark is gone for eight months, most of which is spent in a coma after he faces off again with Conquest. During this time it is later revealed that Eve and Mark's mom, Deborah, bonded over their fear of what could be happening to Mark and they ended up becoming friends.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65490/1811787-atom_eve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1811787\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.3164556962025\" data-width=\"237\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 237px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:231.6%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/65490/1811787-atom_eve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1811787\"><img alt=\"Mark finds Eve has a slightly different body, much to his delight\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" data-width=\"237\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/65490/1811787-atom_eve.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/65490/1811787-atom_eve.jpg 237w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mark finds Eve has a slightly different body, much to his delight\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/65490/1811787-atom_eve.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/6/65490/1811787-atom_eve.jpg 237w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 237px) 100vw, 237px\" data-width=\"237\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mark finds Eve has a slightly different body, much to his delight</figcaption></figure><p>When Mark returned he went to see Eve, however after eight months he stumbled upon a surprise, during this time Eve had gained around sixty pounds. She's ashamed to be seen like this but Mark loves her so much he doesn't even notice it. They stay together for hours talking about what had happened and she learns about how he had been in a coma for months. She eventually gains her self esteem back and goes back to being the old Eve that Mark knew, although she's anxious to lose the weight, Mark on the other hand actually doesn't mind it, in fact it turns out that he actually thinks she's more attractive with the weight.</p><p>However there is still the mystery of what happened to her pregnancy, and after Mark is back she decides she wants to try and catch up with Dupli-Kate and her new husband, the Immortal. They go to have dinner at their place and Eve spends the evening catching up with Kate. However, when she is helping her give her babies a bath, Eve suddenly gets very depressed and starts to tear up. She leaves the house and Mark asks her what is wrong, and it's then that she finally has to break down and tell him that she had an abortion. She tells him that she was so scared about what was going to happen to Mark and she thought he was dead, she couldn't raise this child on her own, especially not with the grief of thinking Mark was dead. Mark just hugs her and both of them cry as he tells her that he is so sorry for what he did.</p><p>When they get home that night Mark finds out that his mother is leaving with his father to go and try and repair their marriage, leaving Mark and Eve alone in their house. It's then that Eve says she can't live with her mother anymore and she's going to move into Mark's now empty house with him. They sleep in his twin size bed at first before she finally makes him move into his parent's room, which she has to clean on an atomic level because he refuses to sleep in a place where his parents have been intimate.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Atom Eve has the power to restructure matter with a thought. As long as she knows how something is made up she can change it into something else and since was created with a great understanding of chemistry and the molecular structure of things as well as an innate knowledge of every law of science, her abilities are only limited by her imagination. She can change living and non-living matter, make atoms obey her will, create new atoms and form complex forms of life out of non-living matter, fly, create force-fields and shape energy to make any object she can visualize. She can augment normally unhealthy food such as cakes and other sweets into nutritious foods as well as re-arrange the environment.</p><p>One major down side of her ability is that any unused atoms are absorbed into her body, which are then removed as waste, she has claimed that on days when she uses her powers a lot she can \"go to the bathroom\" six or seven times.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><p>An evil version of Atom eve was spotted working for the Emperor in <a href=\"/emperors-elite/4060-56490/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56490\">Emperor's Elite</a>, she was known as Atom Shiva, this was most likely a reference to the Hindu god Shiva who was known as The Destroyer or The Transformer, due to the nature of Eve's powers it is a pretty well fitting name.</p>",

He was busy trying to get a suit made to duplicate his powers so he didn't even know they were all dead. He got a suit and became a member of the new team but got into a fight and got put into a coma. When he came out of it, his powers had returned even stronger and he didn't need the suit.</p><p>Currently the public face of The Guardians of the Globe </p><h2>Death</h2><p>During <a href=\"/robot/4005-41166/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41166\">Robot</a>'s initial attempt to take over the Earth, he sent one of his new model drones to Black Samson's barber shop.

When Brit arrived, Mastermind used the dancers to form a giant man-monster to crush Brit. But Brit was able to get to Mastermind and break his control. The result was hundreds of people dropping to the ground and dying instantly. When Brit returned home he was talking to his girlfriend, Jessica, about their future. Jessica revealed to Brit her parents wanted to meet him. Brit managed to weasel out of it as a group of scientists were opening up an experimental portal and they wanted Brit in case anything should come through and something did, Brit was quick to react and destroyed the alien. At the end Donald one of Brit friends and a agent of the government, noticed what appeared to be blood dripping from Brit's nose which may be a sign of deterioration which could be bad for the government. Brit dismissed it saying it wasn't his.</p><p>When Brit did meet Jessica's parents it wasn't a happy sight. Jessica's dad was shocked at his age and Brit accidentally spilled the beans on Jessica's stripping which her dad did not know; he had presumed she went through law school. The father stormed out and Brit went out to talk to him, but was called away by the government. He was sent to destroy a man who was absorbing nukes. Brit jumped form the helicopter and let the boy punch him around till he was tired then Brit snapped his neck. When government ages came down to retrieve him he punched out one and ran. He returned to his home and told Jessica to pack everything she needs and that they're millionaires. On his way out he explained to his friend that the strip joint now belonged to him, paperwork and all. Later Brit showed up at Donald's home and thanked him for the warning. It turns out the government was hoping to catch Brit before he deteriorated and duplicate his power through experimental tests.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Cold Death</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/1802112-susan_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1802112\" data-size=\"small\" style=\"width: 435px\" data-ratio=\"0.94942528735632\" data-width=\"435\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:94.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/1802112-susan_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1802112\"><img alt=\"Susan Brits Wife\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/1802112-susan_5.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/31666/1802112-susan_5.jpg 435w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/31666/1802112-susan_5.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Susan Brits Wife</figcaption></figure><p>Since Brit ran he has been living comfortably in a secluded area with his now wife Jessica, who is now pregnant. That is until the government shows back up to rain on his parade. After the battle Donald asks Brit if he wants his job back and he accepts only this time Donald will be assigning him as commission by <a href=\"/cecil/4005-42576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42576\">Cecil</a>. Meanwhile, back at home Brit smooths things over with Jessica's parents and him and her death catch up over dinner.</p><p>On one of Brit's first missions since returning he has to stop one of his ex-girlfriends, Susan, and a mad scientist from drilling to far into the Earth's core to save her son and potentially destroying the Earth. The next place Brit heads is the strip joint he used to own. Him and Jessica get a warm reception until Brit's job calls him away to take on a giant snow monster. Brit has little luck at first; only damaging his eye. After awhile Brit gets it off balance and uses a special gun Donald gave him that succeeds. For a moment Brit worries that Donald might have have died until he reveals that he is an android (not knowing it himself).</p><p>Later Jessica finally delivers her child whom she names Brittany, apparently, in honor of Brit who's name is also Brittany.</p><h3>Red, White, and Brit</h3><p>We first join Brit fighting off some kind of huge monster and yelling at it saying he has more important things to do. Later he arrives at a test facility where a scientist hopes to launch son of Susan into the sun to help him gain energy. Brit's appearance is to insure safety but it enrages the woman. When the launch is successful Brit comforts the woman much to the surprise and jealousy of Jessica who caught them. When they return home in wait of her parents, she begins questioning if she's too young for him. He writes in off and tries to dispute her beliefs. The talk gets put off hold when the in-laws show up. During the meal a global alien attack breaks out and Brit runs off to help. Even with the rest of the <a href=\"/kirkmanverse/4015-49604/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-49604\">Kirkmanverse</a> heroes, including Brit's ex Susan the battle looks futile. Susan's attempt to help climaxed in her unfortunate death. The battle was going downhill fast, but suddenly hoped emerged in Susan's son who had successfully absorbed enough energy to return. The son destroyed most of the alien ships and returned to the ground. He began to ask for his mother, but when Brit told him she had died he lashed out. Brit told him to calm down because he would kill himself. Brit advice went unheard and he died. The death caused Brit to reexamine himself and he decided to quit the superhero stuff.</p><h3>Epilogue</h3><p>Three weeks later Donald came by to try and convince a shaggy, rugged Brit to rejoin. Brit tells him he can't handle the fact that he was responsible for the death of Susan's husband and the indirect death of her and her son. He tell Donald that they have plenty of other super-heroes that could give him the chance to figure stuff out.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Brit's Power is invulnerability, he has no other power, not super strength or anything else. Due to this power he has an unlimited amount of durability and it is unknown to what level his invulnerability is but it has never been reached.</p><p>Brit's powers are the result of a serum developed by his father some time before World War one and in addition to invulnerability, the serum also slows down his aging process.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url":

"Bulletproof is a member of the Guardians of the Globe. As of right now, he is the only non-relative of Mark Grayson to have taken the Invincible identity. ", "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The young hero named Bulletproof is a recent player in the superhero game, having started his career sometime after <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a> joined the ranks of the worlds heroes. It is not known where or when he began his adventures, but his suit was initially designed for <a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\">Omni-Man</a> years ago and offered to Invincible before <a href=\"/art/4005-49608/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49608\">Art the Tailor</a> presented it to Bulletproof.</p><p>It is revealed much later on that Zandale had a twin brother, Tyrone who excelled in the sciences as well as school. Zandale however was interested in less academic ventures and chose the life of the artist, while his brother garnered the pride and admiration of their parents. Over time, Tyrone would become a geneticist obsessed with obtaining what he apparently prized most; super powers. However in order to complete his research to grant himself powers he would need someone with near identical genes, and so Tyrone drugged and abducted Zandale.</p><p>Subjecting him to his experiments, Tyrone caused an explosion that resulted in Zandale receiving his current powers and abilities, at the cost of killing Tyrone who lacked the invulnerability he granted his twin. At a loss of what to do, Zandale played a double life rather than betray the facade of a perfect son that his parents thought of Tyrone. He split his time impersonating Tyrone for his oblivious parents, who also thought the child they adored had become a superhero instead of a madman causing his own death, and playing the slacking Zandale, still trying to gain their affection in his own way. They would go on believing his now dead brother was saving the world.</p><p>Soon after Bulletproof delved into the world of heroics he tried out for the New Guardians of the Globe, a team designed to replace the original team that had been murdered months before. Though he preformed well, Bulletproof did not make the final cut. However, when the new team's performance failed to meet expectations in its first few months. Bulletproof was added to the roster to augment their abilities. He proudly accepted the membership and quickly displayed the wit and attitude he would come to be known for.</p><p>Bulletproof instantly became a valuable member of the team, assisting them admirably in a massive alien invasion that caused great damage to the Earth. Several months later, the new Guardians were called in to reinforce Invincible in a battle with the henchmen of crime lord <a href=\"/machine-head/4005-4731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4731\">Machine Head</a>. During the battle, the henchman known as <a href=\"/battle-beast/4005-41126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41126\">Battle Beast</a> seriously injured Bulletproof and his teammate <a href=\"/black-samson/4005-41129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41129\">Black Samson</a>. Bulletproof was put out of commission for several weeks while Samson was left comatose. During his recovery, Bulletproof openly voiced his disapproval of <a href=\"/the-immortal/4005-41141/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41141\">Immortal</a>'s leadership of the team.</p><p>Upon his recovery, Bulletproof rejoined the team and was present at their victory against <a href=\"/omnipotus/4005-55178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55178\">Omnipotus</a>, The World Shaper. He also took part in the battle against the evil <a href=\"/mastermind/4005-55340/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55340\">Mastermind</a>, when he temporarily fell under the villain's mind control until Invincible intervened.</p><p>When a version of the Guardians from fifteen years in the future rescued Invincible from an alternate dimension he had been trapped in by <a href=\"/angstrom-levy/4005-41203/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41203\">Angstrom Levy</a>, Bulletproof was still a member of the team. However, the act of rescuing Invincible likely changed the time line this version of the team originally existed in, so Bulletproof's future in his current time line remains unwritten.</p><p>Whatever his future may be, Bulletproof continues as a valuable member of the Guardians of the Globe with both his abilities and his sarcastic wit. It was recently revealed that Zandale is a photographer of sexual and explicate artwork, which fellow Guardian member, Outrun finds very \"excellent.\"</p><h3>Replacing Invincible</h3><p>After Invincible is too sick to do his duties for Invincible Inc., Bulletproof decides to help Atom Eve out by donning the Invincible costume. Stating that he's always liked the costume, Bulletproof flies off to help one of their clients and battles the Order member, the Walking Dread. Despite a tought battle, Bulletproof is able to defeat Walking Dread due to the creature absorbing too much electricity. He returns to Eve where he tries to comfort her due to Mark's condition. However, Zandale crosses the line by wondering if she needs sex to make her feel better. He is quickly kicked out of the house and flies to his girlfriend's house.</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><ul><li>Height: 6'</li><li>Weight: 210 lbs</li><li>Hair: Black</li><li>Eyes: Brown</li><li>Group affiliations: <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">The New Guardians of the Globe</a></li><li>Base of operations: Guardians of the Globe headquarters, Utah</li></ul><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Bulletproof has the superhuman ability to absorb kinetic energy, storing it within his body to be used to fuel his superhuman powers. When Bulletproof has a \"full charge\" he can fly at high speeds (approx 750 mph) and is nearly impervious to physical harm. His natural energy absorbing powers protect him from injury from objects invested with kinetic energy e.g. bullets, shrapnel, physical blows, e.t.c</p><p>Their are limitations to Bulletproof's powers. His resistance to injury does not extend to forces that do not have a great deal of kinetic energy, so he is vulnerable to strangling and crushing attacks. Bulletproof cannot indefinitely sustain a charge of kinetic energy, and maximum exertion of his powers will quickly drain him of potential energy. To address these limitations, The Tailor has equipped Bulletproof with a suit of body armor that protects him from non-kinetic attacks as well as harnessing surplus energy. The distinctive discs on Bulletproof's suit are fuel cells that store superhuman energy, greatly increasing his stamina. He may be able to use the discs as energy grenades as a last resort weapon.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url":

Director Radcliffe revealed that their deaths had been faked, since he thought they were of better use working on the government's side. Subsequently, Cecil thanked the former terrorists by killing them on the spot, earning him a prison sentence on his own. After a couple of months, Cecil was visited in prison by Director Radcliffe, who was stepping down from his job on the Global Defence Agency, and claiming that Cecil would be the only person capable to take over. After declining, Radcliffe told Cecil that he could either be the good guy or the guy who saved the world, but not always both at the same time. Stedman soon accepted the offer.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Omni-Man</h3><p>After a year as the head of the GDA, Stedman noticed <a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\">Omni-Man</a> battling an alien tentacle creature, and shortly thereafter, confronted him. Omni-Man wanted to learn the customs of Earth, something Stedman could grant. In return, Omni-Man explained a highly sugarcoated version of his Viltrumite origin, claiming to represent a \"World Betterment Comittee\" when in reality, he was an advance scout for an invasion. Monitor technology at Pentagon confirmed his alien origin, but concluded that his story was a lie. Cecil didn't care much for it, meaning that as long as Earth was reasonably safe, Omni-Man's reasons for lying hardly mattered. He would regret this years later...</p><h3>Invincible</h3><p>Many years later, Omni-Man revealed his true intentions about conquering Earth to his son <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a>. When Invincible (rather violently) disagreed, a battle of epic proportions ensued, all of their talk recorded by the earpiece the GDA had installed in Omni-Man's ear (to be able to contact him easier in emergency situations). Omni-Man left Earth shortly afterwards, showing little hint of a return. Subsequently, Cecil began to work Invincible much as he had worked with Omni-Man previously, with an earpiece installed to alert the young superhero of emergencies. At the same time, Cecil made sure that Invincible's mother, <a href=\"/deborah-grayson/4005-41160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41160\">Debbie Grayson</a>, wouldn't have to worry about economy (seeing as how Nolan had been responsible for their family's income) or having their identities exposed.</p><p><strong>Death</strong></p><p>After Invincible returns from an alternate universe, he attempts to warn Cecil about Robot's intentions for world domination. Robot overhears and gruesomely kills Cecil.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p><strong>Invincible (Amazon series)</strong></p><p>Cecil appears in the series, voiced by <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324658/\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Walton Goggins</a>. After the death of the Guardians of the Globe, Cecil and the Global Defense Agency investigate. He begins assigning <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Mark Grayson</a> missions while doing so.  </p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-174462/", "id": 174462, "name": "Cold Death", "issue_number": "1"}, "gender": 1, "id": 42576, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/11863/799962-cecil_11_1_.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Main Gallery"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-1001968/", "id": 1001968, "name": "TPB", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-universe-compendium-1-tpb/4000-1001968/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-605086/", "id": 605086, "name": "HC", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-astounding-wolf-man-complete-collection-1-hc/4000-605086/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-508474/", "id": 508474, "name": "Reboot?

"Dupli-Kate is a member of the Guardians of the Globe and a former member of the Teen Team.", "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Centuries ago in medieval China the war lord Fung Cha slew the country's evil emperor, claiming the throne for himself. With his dying breath, the emperor cursed Fung Cha, informing him that the seventh generation after his seventh grandchild would be burdened with a family to large too care for, and driven mad as a result. Just under 20 years ago Fung's descendent Tsing Cha fell victim to that curse. Tsing was just waiting for a daughter, Kate his brother Paul born is right behind, Tsing's wife died giving birth to twin children, Kate and Paul, leaving him to raise the children alone, but when the pair became toddlers they suddenly began to split into hundreds of identical duplicates. Unable to cope, Tsing was institutionalized and the children were taken into state care. Numerous scientists failed to figure how Paul and Kate's powers worked, but luckily when they reached puberty they finally developed control of their powers, able to generate and reabsorb their doppelgangers at will. For a while they formed a crimefighting partnership as Dupli-Kate and Multi-Paul, before Kate joined <a href=\"/robot/4005-41166/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41166\">Robot</a>'s Teen Team.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Dupli-Kate was created by <a href=\"/robert-kirkman/4040-40977/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40977\">Robert Kirkman</a>, her first appearance was in Invincible #2.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>Kate was a valued member of the Teen Team for four years, at some point beginning a clandestine relationship with teammate <a href=\"/rex-splode/4005-41137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41137\">Rex Splode</a>, shortly after Robot announced his intention to disband the group Rex's girlfriend and fellow teammate <a href=\"/atom-eve/4005-40947/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40947\">Atom-Eve</a> caught Rex and Kate together, exposing their affair. Atom-Eve broke up with Rex, and he and Kate became an item.Shortly thereafter the Guardians of the Globe were murdered by <a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\">Omni-Man</a>. Auditions were arranged by the government to find new members to establish a new incarnation of the team, with Robot in charge of selections, Kate and Rex were amongst those chosen. More notable early missions include repelling an extradimensional invasion by the <a href=\"/flaxans/4060-41165/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41165\">Flaxan</a> Empire, apprehending the crimelord <a href=\"/machine-head/4005-4731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4731\">Machine Head</a>, and battling both <a href=\"/omnipotus/4005-55178/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55178\">Omnipotus</a> the world shaper and the mind controlling <a href=\"/master-mind/4005-8655/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-8655\">Mastermind</a>. Kate is now dating the Immortal, her relationship with Rex having ended when he found her cheating on him with her new paramour. Though it is unclear just how seriously Kate views her latest romance, the <a href=\"/the-immortal/4005-41141/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41141\">Immortal</a> is clearly smitten, admitting as much to teammate <a href=\"/black-samson/4005-41129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41129\">Black Samson</a>.</p><p>Not long after the Immortal decides to marry Kate despite how his marriages in the past have left heartbroken and depressed. Kate and the Immortal have a small private wedding and announce to their friends afterwards they are now husband and wife. Rex with a smile then tells the Immortal, \"Congratulations you couldn't have picked a better girl\".</p><p>Right after that the Guardians of the globe are needed to help prevent the sequids attack. Only those with skin strong enough that sequids can't break through are allowed to depart for the trip leaving Kate and a few others behind. At the same time the Lizard League make an attempt to capture a US nuclear missile base to trigger WW3, Cecil has no choice but to send is last three Guardians; Dupli-Kate, Rex Splode, and Shrinking ray (a rip off of ant man).</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>As a result of the supernatural curse placed upon her family, both Dupli-Kate and her brother possess the ability to create identical physical duplicates of them selves at will. It is not known precisely how her powers work, although the duplicates bodies seem to \"split off\" from within her, she does not undergo mitosis process like that of cells, creating identical entities each with half the mass of the original. Each duplicate possesses the same mass as the original. Through concentration, Kate \"splits off\" a single duplicate. Although she can create multiple selves consecutively, she cannot bring into being more than one duplicate at a time. It is not yet known the exact number of duplicates of herself she can create consecutively before taxing the ability. She has produced as many as a hundred at one time. Each of the duplicates is capable of independent thought, feeling and action, although they are telepathically linked from formation to absorption. If one is injured or killed the others would be affected, although the experience would be traumatic for all existing counterparts. It is not known if death to the original body would automatically kill all the other duplicates.</p><p>At first, accidental multiple copies created moral challenges, as large numbers of unwanted copies could not be simply eliminated. However, when it was later realized that the duplicates memories were all linked to the original Kate, it left no moral reason to prevent the reversal process. Removing a Kate duplicate is a relatively simple process due to quantum entanglement (all original particle are linked to there duplicate particles). Dupli-Kate's duplicates remain in existence for as long as she wills them to. When she wills them out of existence, they are seemingly \"absorbed\" back into her body. It is not yet known whether they automatically disappear if the original is rendered unconscious.</p><p>Dupli-Kate also possesses extensive martial arts fighting systems including ground grappling, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Taekwondo, American boxing, Muay Thai, and kickboxing.</p><h2>Character Information</h2><ul><li><b>Real name:</b> Kate Cha</li><li><b>Occupation:</b> Adventurer</li><li><b>Ientity:</b> Secret</li><li><b>Legal status:</b> Citizen of the U.S with no criminal record</li><li><b>Former aliases:</b> None</li><li><b>Place of birth:</b> Republic of China</li><li><b>Marital status:</b> Single</li><li><b>Known relatives:</b> Tsing Cha (Father), Paul Cha (Brother), Fung Cha (Ancestor), Unrevealed mother</li><li><b>Group affiliations:</b> The new <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">Guardians of the Globe</a>, formerly the <a href=\"/teen-team/4060-41090/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41090\">Teen Team</a>, partner of <a href=\"/multi-paul/4005-48737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48737\">Multi-Paul</a></li><li><b>Base of operations:</b> Guardians of the Globe Headquarters, outside Utha</li><li><b>Height:</b> 5' 6\"</li><li><b>Weight:</b> 115 lbs</li><li><b>Hair:</b> Black</li><li><b>Eyes:</b> Brown</li><li><b>Strength level:</b> Kate possesses the normal human strength of a woman her age, build and height who engages in intensive regular exercise.</li></ul>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105532/", "id": 105532, "name": null, "issue_number": "2"}, "gender": 2, "id": 41136, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/84155-29300-dupli-kate.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Gallery,He11eavens army"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-674061/", "id": 674061, "name": "Volume 12", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-12-volume-12/4000-674061/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-664333/", "id": 664333, "name": "The End of All Things Part Two", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-the-end-of-all-things-2-the-end-of-all-/4000-664333/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-660042/", "id": 660042, "name": "The End of All Things Part Twelve", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-144-the-end-of-all-things-part-twelve/4000-660042/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-647984/", "id": 647984, "name": "The End of All Things Part Eleven", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-143-the-end-of-all-things-part-eleven/4000-647984/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-638638/", "id": 638638, "name": "The End of All Things Part Ten;

Chupacabra is a member of the Guardians of the Globe.", "description": "<h2>History </h2><p> While his full history is unknown, El Chupacabra has been one of Mexico's greatest super heroes for years and at times almost saved the world several times with the Help of the Global Defense Agency and Brit. Most recently, while not yet revealed, El Chupacabra ended up cheating on his wife and the affair was discovered and in doing so, she kicked Francisco out of the house. He has since been found drinking his problems away at local bars. He was brought into the Guardians of the Globe in hopes that it would turn his life around but has yet to succeed. During several missions, he was so drunk or hung over that he left his teammates without aide and almost got them killed. <a href=\"/brit/4005-5212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5212\">Brit </a>ended up attacking Francisco and was ready to kick him off the team until he was reminded of his past successes by <a href=\"/cecil-stedman/4005-42576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42576\">Cecil</a>. During the attack by the Order, El Chupacabra was almost beaten by <a href=\"/war-woman/4005-42577/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42577\">War Woman </a>who was able to notice Francisco's cheating and problems and intended to kill him to put him out of his misery, which Francisco accepted. However, <a href=\"/cast-iron/4005-76659/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76659\">Cast Iron </a>jumped in the way and took the axe for him, leaving him on the brink of death and Brit telling El Chupacabra that if Cast Iron dies, his blood was on his hands.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>El Chupacabra largely seems to possess strength at about the level of an Olympic-level athlete but has demonstrated moments of berserker strength, like when he grappled with <a href=\"/wolf-man/4005-43667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43667\">Wolf-Man</a>. He can grow claws that seem capable of causing great damage and possesses good reflexes and fighting skill.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url":

He had a magic talisman that, when he swallowed it, turned him green and intangible, thus the name Green Ghost.", "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>Green Ghost's origin is unknown. The only thing known about him is that he is African American, and somehow acquired an amulet that, when digested, turns him into an intangible green entity. He was killed by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\" href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" slug=\"omni-man\">Omni-Man</a>, as well as his entire <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-globe\">Guardians of the Globe</a> team.</p><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Upon ingesting a small, jade colored amulet of unknown origin, the young man who would become the Green Ghost would undergo a transformation altering his body's physical appearance, seemingly generating a green aura emanating from within him. When in his Green Ghost form, his facial features were obscured to the point of being unidentifiable. As the Green Ghost he possessed the ability to become intangible at will. He was capable of reducing the mass of his atoms to practically zero, yet have them retain their chemical properties and volume.</p><p>By fine tuning these atomic forces so that they applied to other atoms in his body and not to the sub-atomic structures of the world around him, the Green Ghost could pass through solid matter like so many neutrinos, retaining his form while still capable of conscious thought and action. He could become weightless and intangible, unable to be touched by solid matter.</p><p>The Green Ghost was able to generate small, green hued, billowing cloud like constructs that defied gravity, floated in the air and appeared amorphous yet were capable of supporting the full weight of an adult human male standing on them. The cloud forms retained their shape as long as the Green Ghost willed them to exist, dissipating when he had no futher use for them.</p><p>The Green Ghost could fly by altering his mass at the sub-atomic level to create changes in inertia. The Green Ghost was able to mentally control this on a bodily level, so that all his atoms could be given a net gain in inertia in just one direction. This allowed his body to fly at very great speeds simply by willing it. A visible green energy contrail was left behind him while in flight. He was also capable of withstanding the great extreames of temperature caused by the build up of friction within the atmosphere and surviving without difficulties in the vacuum of outer space.</p><p>The Green Ghost would revert back back to his human form after regurgitating back up and out of his body the amulet he had ingested to trigger the initial transformation.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105537/", "id": 105537, "name": null, "issue_number": "7"}, "gender": 1, "id": 41139, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/84367-146970-green-ghost.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Green Ghost"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-506222/", "id": 506222, "name": "Reboot?

His father belongs to a super-powered alien race known as the <a href=\"/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\"> Viltrumites</a>. Being that Mark\u2019s <a href=\"/deborah-grayson/4005-41160/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41160\"> mother</a> was human, there was always a possibility of him never acquiring his father\u2019s abilities. After living most of his young adult life as a regular teenager, one day he begins to exhibit strength, flight and invulnerability. With his father\u2019s help he dons on a costume and begins to fight crime. After his civilian identity was warned that he was not invincible, his super-powered identity cleverly takes that very name, Invincible.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Invincible, Mark Sebastian Grayson, was created by writer <a href=\"/robert-kirkman/4040-40977/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40977\"> Robert Kirkman</a> and artist <a href=\"/cory-walker/4040-42732/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-42732\"> Cory Walker</a> to be used as an ongoing character for <a href=\"/image/4010-513/\" data-ref-id=\"4010-513\"> Image Comics</a> whom first appeared in <a href=\"/tech-jacket/4050-22158/\" data-ref-id=\"4050-22158\"> Tech Jacket</a> issue 1 on October 2002. From the beginning of issue to modern Invincible comics, Robert Kirkman has been writing all of the issues that focus on Invincible with <a href=\"/ryan-ottley/4040-46140/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-46140\"> Ryan Ottley</a> as artist who joined onto the series with issue 8. Since then the two have made Invincible a great success in the comic book industry and he has been accepted in Image Continuity.</p><h2>Character Evolution</h2><p>Mark changed not only emotionally but also in his powers. His father tried to get a costume made for him, but Mark could not decide on his costume so the superhero tailor Art Rosenbaum, told him to come back later after he had picked out a name. After protecting a nerd from being bullied, Mark is sent to the principal's office, where the principal tells him he is not \"Invincible.\" A major turning point is when he finally picks his name as Invincible, this act changes his persona into a bold, cocky and heroic individual that he would become.</p><h2>Story Arcs</h2><h3><b>Meet the Teen Team</b></h3><p>Two months later Mark met the <a href=\"../../teen-team/65-41090/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Teen Team</a>, a young group of heroes consisting of <a href=\"../../robot/29-41166/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Robot</a>, <a href=\"../../dupli-kate/29-41136/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dupli-Kate</a>, <a href=\"../../rex-splode/29-41137/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Rex-Splode</a> and <a href=\"../../atom-eve/29-40947/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Atom Eve</a> and helped them capture <a href=\"/mauler-twins/4005-41202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41202\">Maulers</a>, two super strong super smart twins. Invincible would also team up with his father to battle an alien invasion from a group called the <a href=\"../../flaxans/65-41165/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Flaxans</a> who captured Nolan before and wanted revenge for his leading a revolt and escaping. However their dimension's time moves faster than ours; they created devices to halt their aging here, but those were soon destroyed and the Flaxians retreated. At school the next day he recognizes <a href=\"../../atom-eve/29-40947/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Atom Eve</a>, a member of the <a href=\"../../teen-team/65-41090/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Teen Team</a>. The two become friends and fight their teacher when they discover he had been strapping bombs to students and blowing them up in some elaborate scheme for vengeance for the loss of his son and wife that left him. While <a href=\"../../omni-man/29-40550/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Omni-Man</a> was out of town Invincible fought <a href=\"../../allen/29-40950/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Allen the Alien</a>. Instead of being an evil alien, he was really testing the, champions of planets. Omni-Man had always thought he was a bad guy because he didn't know that was Allen's job. After talking with <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a>, Allen realized he had been going to the wrong planet for fifteen years and left.</p><h3><b>I Love College</b></h3><p>After High School, Mark left for college. While visiting Upstate University with his friend William they were attacked by a <a href=\"../../reanimen/65-54660/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Reanimen</a> (a robot/zombie), which was created by an evil student named <a href=\"../../da-sinclair/29-54661/\" rel=\"nofollow \">D.A. Sinclair</a>, who had been using homeless men in his experiments to turn the dead into his slaves and added robot parts to make them easier to control. William was looking for <a href=\"../../rick-sheridan/29-55176/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Rick Sheridan</a>, who was turned into a Reaniman, and acting as a homeless man, allowed himself to be captured by D.A. Mark fought the Reanimen and stopped D.A., and as a result, William learned his secret identity. Meanwhile, Atom Eve quit the Teen Team after finding out that her boyfriend <a href=\"../../rex-splode/29-41137/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Rex-Splode</a> was cheating on her with <a href=\"../../dupli-kate/29-41136/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Dupli-Kate</a>. She quit the team and started working with Invincible more. By the time she realized she had feelings for Mark, he had already been asked out by <a href=\"../../amber-bennett/29-41127/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Amber Bennett</a> and they started dating. She never told Mark that she liked him.</p><p>Soon after, the members of the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">Guardians of the Globe</a>, (Earth's best superhero team) were murdered. A new team was formed (made mostly of members of the Teen Team). Invincible was offered a spot but declined. Mark and Eve still worked with them on several occasions. Mark would also fight and easily thwart a group of terrorists called the <a href=\"/lizard-league/4060-49628/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49628\">Lizard League (Salamander</a>, <a href=\"/iguana/4005-49630/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49630\">Iguana</a>, <a href=\"/komodo-dragon/4005-49632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49632\">Komodo Dragon</a>, <a href=\"/king-lizard/4005-49629/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49629\">King Lizard</a>) attempting to poison a towns water supply. He would soon meet <a href=\"/doc-seismic/4005-54718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54718\">Doc Seismic</a>, who uses wrist bands to create earthquakes, and likes fighting famous super heroes.</p><h3><b>New World Order</b></h3><p>When it was discovered that it was <a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\">Omni-Man</a> who had destroyed the Guardians, Mark confronts him. Omni-Man then reveals to his son that the Viltrumites weren't really peaceful explorers, but violent conquerors. Omni-Man had been assigned to take over Earth and he offered Mark the chance to do it with him. Mark refuses, and the two fight. Omni-Man tells Invincible that his whole live has been a lie, that he never cared about his mother, only that she was a ''pet'' to him, that he never loved her (this is later all proven to be a lie after). Omni-Man easily wins, leaving Invincible in a coma for two weeks before leaving the planet himself. Upon his recovery, Mark started working for the <a href=\"/global-defense-agency/4060-57306/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-57306\">Global Defense Agency</a>. His liaison is <a href=\"/cecil-stedman/4005-42576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42576\">Cecil Stedman</a>, who also used to be Omni-Man's liaison as well.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14661/421057-invin3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421057\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.54937163375224\" data-width=\"557\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 557px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.9%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/14661/421057-invin3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-421057\"><img alt=\"Invincible's first encounter with the other Viltrumites\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14661/421057-invin3.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/14661/421057-invin3.jpg 557w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/14661/421057-invin3.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/14661/421057-invin3.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Invincible's first encounter with the other Viltrumites</figcaption></figure><p>He was to use his machine to find his counterparts and use their knowledge to \"better the human race\". Angstrom was being helped by Mark's old foes the Mauler Twins; he freed them from prison so they would help him with their super-intelligence. When Mark attacked the twins and their other-dimensional counterparts that were summoned by Angstrom, Angstrom removed himself from his machine to plead for Invincible's life. Sadly doing so caused a error in the machine and it exploded. After wards the New Guardians found Mark. Angstrom was found by a lone surviving Mauler. He was horribly disfigured (body and mind) but stated his plan is a success. He soon vowed revenge on Invincible, blaming him for the explosion. Mark the discovers his father has a new alien wife, Andressa, who is a member of a bug like race with a 9 month life span, and a child <a href=\"/oliver-grayson/4005-49063/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49063\">Oliver</a> who looks like a human with purple skin, on another planet. Oliver ages like his mother but Nolan thinks that once his powers come forth he will age slowly, like a <a href=\"/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\">Viltrumite</a>. They are then attacked by <a href=\"/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\">Viltrumites</a> and Nolan has his back broken while saving Mark and is arrested. Nolan tells Mark to read his books before he is taken away. The Viltrumites then give Nolan's assignment of taking over Earth to Mark and he is given a 100 year deadline. Mark reads Nolan's books, and discovers that his father has been trying to use supposed science fiction to tell people how to hurt and defeat the Viltrumites. After being asked by Oliver's mother, Invincible takes his alien half-brother back home with him so his human mother can help rebuild her home and keep him safe. His mother agrees to raise him. Mark and Amber then visit Eve in Africa who was helping the natives with the use her powers. However Eve was annoyed with her desire to be closer to Mark, but Amber being around made this harder for her.</p><h3><b>Marvel</b></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5812/277548-113975-invincible.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-277548\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.515\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:151.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/0/5812/277548-113975-invincible.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-277548\"><img alt=\"Invincible &amp; Spider-Man\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5812/277548-113975-invincible.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5812/277548-113975-invincible.jpg 400w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Invincible &amp; Spider-Man\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5812/277548-113975-invincible.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/5812/277548-113975-invincible.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 422px) 100vw, 422px\" data-width=\"422\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Invincible &amp; Spider-Man</figcaption></figure><p>Mark rushes home after a threatening phone call. When Mark arrives he finds his mother in Levy's clutches. Angstrom attempts to weaken Invincible by dragging him through various dimensions. It is here Mark meets <a href=\"/spider-man/4005-1443/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1443\">Spider-Man</a> and the <a href=\"/new-avengers/4060-42520/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-42520\">New Avengers</a>. Invincible meets Spider-man's family in the process too and realizes that he has a lot in common with this person. He teams up with Spider-Man to take down Doctor Octopus. After finally beating Doc Ock, Invincible finds a portal that takes him to his home dimension and sees that his mom is beaten up.</p><h3><b>Revenge</b></h3><p>In anger and through irrationality Invincible beats Levy to death because of what he had done to his mother. Mark is then rescued by a group of Guardians from 15 years in the future, where Eve tells him that she loves him and to tell his Eve how he feels so she can move on. Once he returns he attempts to tell Eve how he feels, instead the two wind up kissing. Then they are interrupted by a Martian invasion, leaving this unresolved. Mark then begins to read the books written by his father, it is right there when he realizes that what he is reading contains information about how to kill or hurt Viltrumites.</p><h3><b>Next Invasion</b></h3><p>Later while Mark is dealing with a separate alien invasion alongside a group of aliens called <a href=\"/sequids/4060-55695/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55695\">Sequids</a>, a small group of the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">Guardians</a> in Montana are fighting the <a href=\"/lizard-league/4060-49628/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49628\">Lizard League</a> who are trying to start a nuclear holocaust.

However Komodo Dragon, Iguana and Salamander also died during the battle. After a misunderstanding and a battle with Allen the Alien, The Immortal leaves the team, due to what happened to Kate. Eve returns to Earth after finding out that Mark has broken up with Amber due to some troubles because of Mark's superhero life and her having feelings for a guy named Gary. The two talk, and Mark informs her about her future if she doesn't move on. Later, Mark has lunch with his mom and talks about her new relationship. They are interrupted by a Viltrumite woman named <a href=\"/anissa/4005-48505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48505\">Anissa</a>. The two Viltrumites fight and she defeats Mark, then reminds him of his duty to take over Earth, but he (respectfully) declines. Allen the Alien is taken prisoner by the Viltrumites as a part of his plan to find Nolan; after learning about his books and his rebellion against Viltrum, Allen hopes to be placed in the same prison as Nolan so that he can save him from being executed. Invincible and Rex Splode team up to defeat <a href=\"/multi-paul/4005-48737/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48737\">Multi-Paul</a> , Dupli-Kate's twin brother, who is angry over his sister's death.

She wanted to stop her brother without taking him to prison, but when she arrived to help Invincible she found that he had already stopped her brother and was going to send him to prison.</p><p>When Oliver's powers begin developing, he asks Invincible if he can help him fight crime.

He beats up Darkwing, and discovers that no one knows that he was actually a murderer. He leaves angrily. He talks with Atom Eve about making the biggest mistake of his life, and sees Cecil. Cecil brings him into the white room, and uses the Reanimen to attack Mark. It appears Cecil thinks that Mark has began to cross over to the dark side. Because he hasn't, and has a horrible temper, this could be the end of Cecil.</p><p>Mark fights a horde of <a href=\"/reanimen/4060-54660/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54660\">Reanimen</a>, only to find that Cecil has another way of keeping him in check.

The fugitive turns out to be <a href=\"/wolf-man/4005-43667/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-43667\"> Wolf-man</a>.</p><h3>Invincible War</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36276/825830-invincible60___invinciblearmy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-825830\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.765\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.5%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36276/825830-invincible60___invinciblearmy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-825830\"><img alt=\"Invincible War Begins\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36276/825830-invincible60___invinciblearmy.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36276/825830-invincible60___invinciblearmy.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36276/825830-invincible60___invinciblearmy.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Invincible War Begins\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36276/825830-invincible60___invinciblearmy.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36276/825830-invincible60___invinciblearmy.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36276/825830-invincible60___invinciblearmy.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Invincible War Begins</figcaption></figure><p>Finally after planning, Angstrom Levy made his move. When Mark thought he killed him and left, Angstrom actually hadn't died just yet and had enough energy to make one last portal. This one took him to a dimension where a group of aliens healed him of his wounds. Later using his powers he traveled to other dimensions and gathered a dozen evil versions of Invincible. They launched a massive assault on the planet lead by Angstrom with the intent on not just causing damage but also ruining the world's view of Invincible. Many major cities where destroyed by the Invincibles like London, New York, Tokyo and more. Superheroes and super hero teams all around the world joined forces to fight the Invincibles. From the darkest streets of New York, <a href=\"/spawn/4005-3381/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-3381\"> Spawn</a> faced a duplicate Invincible in the alleys, the duplicate stated the he already killed him once and he would do it again. Outside the planet that we call Earth, <a href=\"/tech-jacket/4005-49605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49605\"> Tech Jacket</a> faced a weaker version of Invincible. After Mark beats one of his counterparts, <a href=\"/capes-inc/4060-55235/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55235\"> Capes</a> Inc responded to a prison break caused by one of the Invincible's from the other dimensions, but accidentally mistook Mark for another duplicate. Mark was later attacked by the Capes crew, only to have the time taken to explain that he was not a duplicate. Afterwards, they teamed up and responded to distress calls from across the globe. However, they were not the only ones to respond to the call, <a href=\"/youngblood/4060-5196/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-5196\"> Youngblood</a>, <a href=\"/cyberforce/4060-25321/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-25321\"> Cyberforce</a>, the <a href=\"/dynamo-5/4060-43292/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-43292\"> Dynamo 5</a>, and <a href=\"/brit/4005-5212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5212\"> Brit</a> also engaged in mission set ahead. Sadly however millions of people died including Darkwing and Rex-Splode and only a couple Invincibles where killed. However after their first assault, Angstrom wanted them to go after this dimensions Invincible but they wanted to finish the take over. Unable to control them anymore Angstrom used his powers to strand them in another dimension but as he did that Mark and Oliver attacked him. Goaded by his anger and Oliver; Mark was ready to kill Angstrom but he escapes death losing his arm. He went back to the beings that healed him but due to his failure they informed him he works for them now. After Angstrom's defeat, all local areas familiar to Invincible were utterly destroyed and unusable to any humans. Now is the time for reconstruction, but how will Mark/Invincible cope with this world breaking event.</p><h3>Aftermath</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-825841\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.76976976976977\" data-width=\"999\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 999px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.0%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-825841\"><img alt=\"Clean Up\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg 999w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Clean Up\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg 999w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/3/36276/825841-00clean_up.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Clean Up</figcaption></figure><p>Invincible visits Eve in the hospital often while the rest of the super powered community cleans up after the war. Invincible later joins in but blames himself for much of the death and destruction, but he isn't the only one. Many of the human populace view him as the cause of the chaos. <a href=\"/powerplex/4005-60278/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-60278\"> Power Plex</a> (who chose to help in the fight) even attacks him when he goes to the clean up and <a href=\"/badrock/4005-5187/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5187\"> Badrock</a> has to hold him down and take him back to custody.

After some more self loathing a Viltrumite named <a href=\"/conquest/4005-61561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61561\"> Conquest</a> shows up to remind Invincible of his job of taking over earth but Invincible is some what glad to see him as he needs to hit something and the two get ready to fight. When the titans collided, buildings were shattered and the force of the 2 caused enormous power to serge from their bodies.</p><p>The fight rages on between Conquest and Invincible. Invincible get in a few good hits but Conquest is better trained and starts dominating in the fight. Oliver tries to help but almost gets himself killed.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/17055/1187397-invincible62___eve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1187397\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.8025\" data-width=\"400\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.3%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/17055/1187397-invincible62___eve.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1187397\"><img alt=\"Eve Dead!?\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17055/1187397-invincible62___eve.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/17055/1187397-invincible62___eve.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17055/1187397-invincible62___eve.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eve Dead!?\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17055/1187397-invincible62___eve.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/17055/1187397-invincible62___eve.jpg 400w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/17055/1187397-invincible62___eve.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eve Dead!?</figcaption></figure><p>Eve wakes up and rushes to help Mark, but she is killed by Conquest. In his anger, Invincible promises to kill Conquest. They continue to fight despite Mark's body having been broken and his excessive bleeding. His rage allows him to turn the tide as he destroys Conquest's robotic arm. Somehow Eve comes back to life thanks to her powers and fires a massive energy beam at Conquest that burns all the skin off his body. Invincible continues to fight him as the Viltrumite isn't done yet. In the end, Invincible headbutts Conquest over and over again until his skull is crushed, killing him... or so it seems. Invincible then collapses to the ground due to his injuries as the heroes show up to help him.</p><p>Mark awakens in the Pentagon hospital with Eve by his side. The two reconcile with Mark noticing that Eve's breasts have gotten larger, leading to an intimate moment between them. He is extremely upset because he thought that he lost her. This moment is quickly interrupted by Debbie Grayson. Later on, Invincible joins the other heroes at the funeral for Rex Splode, and afterwards goes to see Oliver in the hospital. Mark then reveals a shocking revelation he had during his fight with Conquest; in order to truly protect Earth, Invincible must kill every villain he encounters from now on.</p><h3>Preparation for War</h3><p>In this two issue mini with artist Cory Walker, Kirkman focuses on Allen, and Nolan. Allen and Nolan have just escaped from the Viltrumite prison in which they were being held captive. Their primary focus is going to certain parts of the universe, and finding things that can hurt the Viltrumites. Nolan (having been on many adventures himself) knows what can hurt them. It is also noted that there was a virus produced by rebels of the Viltrumite empire which was successful in killing a large number of them and in turn leaving an extremely small population of Viltrumites alive. It seems the reason they need to inhabit earth is because they can successfully re-breed their population there.</p><p>Nolan's novels are are actually brought to life when Allen discovers that the Space Racer (a man Nolan supposedly killed) is still alive. He has a special type of weapon that returns to him automatically when touched by other individual. Nolan and Allen try to save him by digging him out of the rubble. Finally the Space Race is exposed and tries to kill Nolan. When Space Racer tries to kill Nolan, Nolan explains that he has switched sides. Space Racer doesn't believe him at first, but Allen then reassures him and he agrees to play a role in the upcoming war. It is also revealed that the Coalition has the virus that killed 99.9 % of the Viltrumites at their disposal.</p><h3>Back on Earth</h3><p>Back on earth, Invincible and the rest of the superhero committee seem to be finishing reconstructing the cities of the world. Invincible then gets attack by a new villain called <a href=\"/dinosaurus/4005-67874/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67874\"> Dinosaurus</a>. He then proceeds to rant Invincible on how he failed to save the world. After a quick fight Invincible is just about to kill Dinosaurus, just then the Guardians Of The Globe arrive. Robot then asks Invincible if he was really going to kill Dinosaurus.</p><p>Later at Eve's house, Mark explains to Eve what happened the city. Then they have dinner with Eve's parents. After a long and awkward dinner Mark and Eve talk about the prison meeting they have the other day. After the prison meeting , in which Invincible agrees to not charge the prison for 3 months, they both meet an older Oliver flying around with a new costume now calling himself Young Omni-Man.Oliver goes on and tells them that there's no one on the house so they can have some fun. While this is all happening Conquest, who was secretly kept alive by the government, escapes from the facility he's at. It is that night that Eve realizes she is pregnant with Mark's child.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1212821\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.758\" data-width=\"1000\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1212821\"><img alt=\"Back to basics\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Back to basics\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg 1000w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/5/58664/1212821-inv_returns_by_wya.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Back to basics</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href=\"/sequids/4060-55695/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55695\"> Sequids</a> commence their attack lead by <a href=\"/rus-livingston/4005-55377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55377\"> Rus Livingston</a>.

Atom Eve sucker punches her and rushes to see if Invincible is ok. Right there Cecil enters the room and tells Invincible that the Sequids are back.</p><p>He then heads off to fight the invasion along with other heroes. The battle seems hopeless, leaving Invincible with only one choice: to kill him. After Invincible kills the possessed he quickly leaves the scene and feels guilt over for what he's done.

Cecil tell Mark how he feels about the situation at hand.

Telling him that the black and blue costume sometimes feels like a curse and that he can't even look at himself anymore. Art tell Mark that he is a good man and tell him that he doesn't have to wear that costume anymore and gives an updated version of his old costume. Invincible then meets Eve at his house and asks her if she wants to go to have dinner. Right there Invincible's father arrives, with Allen the Alien and tells him that war is upon them. Mark tells Eve what has happened so far.

Invincible declines, saying that he is busy and tell her to see if Oliver can take over that instead of him. Eve agrees but tells him to hurry. Later on, in Mark's house, him and Oliver are discussing whether they should bring Oliver or not but Oliver was being persistent and told Mark that he might need his help. Later on their father agrees into bringing Oliver with them.</p><p>After an emotional goodbye to Eve, Mark , along with his father, his brother Oliver and now the recruited <a href=\"/tech-jacket/4005-49605/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49605\"> Tech Jacket</a>, they all head off to space with Allen the alien to meet the <a href=\"/coalition-of-planets/4060-41132/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41132\"> Coalition of Planets</a> . It was on the way to meet up with the Coalition that they get attack by the fully recovered Conquest and 2 other Viltrumites. where they all fight and in the middle of the fight Oliver loses his breath and is forced to leave and find the nearest planet to catch some air , Conquest follows him and just about as he is to attack Oliver, Invincible cuts him off and the 2 of them continue they're fight.</p><p>After a tough battle, Invincible finally manages to kill Conquest once and for all but it also left him in the verge of death.

Meanwhile,</p><p>The Viltrumite war finally started. After some months, Mark finally regain consciousness and asked his father about what happened and if he was the one to have killed Conquest. Nolan corrects Mark by telling him that it was him ( Invincible) that have been the one that killed him. They all head off to assist and stop a Viltrumite attack on one of the Coalition's planet.

They all head out to space, finally reaching the Viltrumite planet. Thaedus then gets slashed by one woman Viltrumite, but Battle Beast cuts in and begins to fight her. <a href=\"/grand-regent-thragg/4005-72505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72505\"> Thragg</a> arrives with some Viltrumites, just then Space Racer arrives with monsters that can battle the Viltrumites.Mark and Oliver fight some Viltrumites, until Invincible finally fights Thragg only to be pushed aside.

Mark then heads to find Oliver's body, crying.</p><p>Then, Thragg attacks Invincible and even with Nolan's help, they both seem to be defeated by Thragg and are both left for dead by the Viltrumites.

Mark wakes up 2 weeks later to find out that his brother and father are still alive and is informed by Allen the Viltrumites have disappeared and are nowhere to be found. The Mark deduces that they have headed to Earth. During their travels Mark has nightmares about the fate of Earth. Upon arriving home he finds everything normal. He and his father are confronted by Thragg who confirms that the Viltrumites have indeed arrived on Earth but rather than conquering it they have assimilated themselves into the populace. Thragg proposes a temporary halt to hostilities. The Viltrumites will not attack Earth until their numbers are greater (coupling with the human populace as Omni-Man did). Mark is hesitant to agree but given the choice of fighting now or fighting some time in the future (perhaps distant future) he reluctantly agrees.</p><h3>The Destruction of Las Vegas</h3><p>After the way he has since then Mark has reunited with his love Eve.

Surprisingly, Mark isn't angry at all, and sees that they can help for the greater good.</p><p>Called by Cecil yet again, Invincible sees what good the government is doing by using the glassed Vegas as a source of solar energy. Invincible realizes that <a href=\"/dinosaurus/4005-67874/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-67874\"> Dinosaurus</a> was right about his Las Vegas plan. With this, Mark visits <a href=\"/atom-eve/4005-40947/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40947\"> Eve</a> and asks her to trust him and to love him no matter what. Invincible frees Dinosaurus in hopes of becoming partners, and helping the world for the greater good.

During a brief argument with Eve about his new ways of using his powers <a href=\"/cecil-stedman/4005-42576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42576\">Cecil </a>interrupts the conversation to declare that Allen is entering Earth's orbit. Puzzled as to why his father wouldn't have come Invincible meets with Allen and greets his healed brother Oliver. However it is then that they unveil their plans to introduce the virus into earth's atmosphere, a plan which endangers human life. Invincible disavows their plan and attacks both Allen and Oliver. During the scuffle however none other than <a href=\"/grand-regent-thragg/4005-72505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72505\">Regent Thragg </a>enters the scene, vowing to help Invincible against his assailants. Despite threats, a standoff was reached until the Guardians of the Globe attacked leading Oliver to take the Scourge Virus to Earth and release it. However, when Mark attacked Oliver to prevent the attack, the virus was released on Mark point blank. Infected, Mark was taken to Thragg's ship on the Moon to be treated. While Mark was sick <a href=\"/bulletproof/4005-41130/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41130\">Bulletproof </a>decided to wear his costume and fill in for him. It was soon revealed by Thragg's scientists that Mark and Nolan were part of the original bloodline of the Viltrumite King. Knowing he could never have a traitor taking over his roll, Thragg decided to secretly kill Mark until Dinosaurus stepped in and fought him, but was almost killed in the process. Dinosaurus used timed explosions to escape with Mark to his secret base on Earth. Mark awakes in Dinosaurus' base and Dinosaurus appearing dead soon reverts to his human form. At first it seems he may not be able to return to his Dinosaurus form, but Mark's efforts prevail and he transforms and explains the situation. Meanwhile, Eve goes to Cecil to attempt to go to the moon and visit Mark, but Cecil cannot contact the Viltrumites. Eve goes to the moon and asks Thragg where Mark is and he explains that Dinosaurus has kidnapped him. Eve tells everyone else and asks Allen where Dinosaurus' base is, he leads them there and they attack Dinosaurus believing he intends to hurt Mark. Mark tries to explain the situation, but they aren't listening to him and he punches Allen to get him to stop, but his arm breaks from the punch and everyone is shocked. It is revealed that he does not have all his abilities because of the Scourge virus which leaves Viltrumites weaker, so his arm breaks apart because he has lost his invulnerability. Mark then fears he may never get his powers back because there have been cases, though rare of previous Viltrumites never regaining their abilities after being affected by the Scourge virus. Mark fears he may never be Invincible again.</p><p>Mark is rushed to the Pentagon for surgery. After he has settled, he states that this may take some getting used to. Eve has to protect him in a force field while the Guardians take down Octoboss. He goes home, feeling helpless, noting that he may never be Invincible again. A Flaxan invasion of London occurs and Mark asks Eve if he can go. Eve says no, citing that he will be unprotected. After the battle gets intense, Eve decides to go to London herself. Mark watches the news and becomes frustrated, kicking a table. Oliver and Allen arrive to Mark's house, and Mark displaces his frustration onto the duo. Mark apologizes after the duo give their reasons and Oliver asks to speak with Mark in private. Oliver apologizes to Mark for infecting him and they hug. Eve arrives, says goodbye to the duo, and asks Mark if they want to have sex. Mark says yes, though mentioning that not having his powers don't make it the same. Afterwards, Mark begins to feel worthless because his powers desensitize him. Mark would later go to a comic book signing for Science Dog. That night, Mark and Eve begin to have an intimate moment. As they progress, Mark discovers that his powers are back.</p><h3>The Death Of Everyone</h3><p>After discovering that his powers are back, Mark and Bulletproof have a conversation about Bulletproof helping Invincible Inc. Mark allows Bulletproof to keep the Invincible costume and flies off to Dinosaurus's base in his other one. Dinosaurus says that while Mark lost his powers, Dinosaurus had a plan to stop the effects of global warming and famine. He informs Mark that he has placed a bomb in Los Angeles. Mark rushes to Los Angeles to find the bombs. He calls Cecil so that he have the Guardians assist him. After the Guardians arrive, Dinosaurus arrives to the scene and gets into a brief argument with Mark. Dinosaurus mocks Mark for saving Los Angeles when billions matter more. Dinosaurus also reveals to Mark that Los Angeles was a distraction and that he placed a bomb in Greenland, which subsequently detonates. Mark flies up to the air and sees that the effect flooded many major cities around the world.</p><p>Mark becomes angry and grabs Dinosaurus to crash him into the ground. Dinosaurus attempts to reasons to him but to no avail. Mark continues to attack him until Dinosaurus launches him. Dinosaurus tries to get Mark to see the \"bigger picture\" but Mark punches him. He demands Dinosaurus to hear his side and declares that Dinosaurus must die.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8043897\" data-ratio=\"0.76861167002012\" data-width=\"3976\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 3976px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:76.9%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8043897\"><img alt=\"Mark in his comatose state\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg 3976w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mark in his comatose state\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg 3976w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043897-588ad2c2-d34f-4e12-bb7e-88c865a5a10a.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mark in his comatose state</figcaption></figure><p>Dinosaurus defeats Mark and declares that he must die instead. Dinosaurus supposedly kills him by smashing his head in, and dismembers him for the world to see. However, it is revealed that Dinosaurus put Mark in a coma, utilizing Mark's vulnerable ears, and instead killed a depowered, hastily made clone of Mark. He explains that though Dinosaurus is getting rid of a problem, he caused more harm than good. Dinosaurus realizes that Mark is right and frees him from his coma.</p><p>Dinosaurus stated that he developed a god-complex and that he was only trying to save people. Mark asks Dinosaurus for help, but he refuses. Dinosaurus says that there will be some good that comes from his flooding the cities. Hoping to atone for his mistakes, Dinosaurus asks Mark to kill him. Mark walks out of Dinosaurus's base with blood on his clothes, signifying that Dinosaurus is dead. Cecil arrives to see Mark. Cecil reveals the casuality rate and Mark asks Cecil to see Eve before he goes to prison. Cecil instead gives Mark a chance to work for him again. He gives Mark the earpiece and Mark heads home to see Eve. He notices his parents are there too and they chat, relieved to hear that Mark isn't dead. Mark and Eve go to talk in private at his home roof. Mark reveals that he is working for Cecil again, much to Eve's shock. Mark goes on to say that he was reckless and he shouldn't make the same mistakes. Eve reveals to Mark that she is pregnant.</p><h3>Back with the Government</h3><p>Mark is initially in shock but states that he will stand with whatever decision Eve makes. Not wanting to get an abortion again, Eve decides to keep the child. Mark, excited to be a father, embraces her. They find Nolan and Debra kissing one another. The next day, Mark and Eve head to help the Guardians clear debris. Robot asks Mark why he's here due to his apparent death. Robot's drone attacks Mark until Cecil intervenes to take Mark to the Pentagon. Cecil apologizes and Mark informs Cecil that Nolan is back on Earth. Mark also mentions that he will be a father and asks for his assistance. Mark finally asks Cecil to see Dinosaurus to make sure he's dead, noting what Cecil did with Conquest. Cecil provides the corpse, which Mark identifies as true due to a special marking he placed on it. Mark heads home and asks that a superhero consultant named Sherry to check on Eve's fetus. Reluctant at first, Eve allows her to do it. Sherry uses her X-Ray vision and sees that the fetus is fine.

After they have sex, Eve realizes that her making the ring may have harmed the fetus. Mark calls Sherry and she reveals that the fetus is alive. However, her previous statement was \"playing it safe\" and that she must not ever use her powers. She reveals that the calories burned using her powers can feed on the fetus in order to give her body energy. While Eve was away, Mark would battle Mauler again, believing him to be dead. After he and the Guardians defeat Mauler, he heads home to discover that Angstrom Levy has taken his fiancee taken hostage.</p><p>He rushes to Levy and is sent to the same dimension that Mark supposedly killed him in. He watches in shock and realizes that an alternate version of him has resorted to cannibalism to survive. Not recognizing him at first, the alternate Mark asks him to join in. He then realizes who Mark is and attempts to eat him. Mark attempts to reason with the cannibal Sinister Mark, but to no avail. Another version of Mark, \"Mohawk Mark\", arrives and offers assistance. Mark assists his alternate version in taking out the cannibalistic one. Mark returns back to his reality and Mohawk Mark follows suit. Mohawk Mark charges into Levy, but Angstrom reveals that he has had a change of heart after talking to Eve. Levy also reveals that many versions of Mark are evil and it should scare him. He surrenders and opens a portal back to the alternate Mark's home reality. Mohawk Mark quickly takes Angstrom with him and the portal closes. Mark asks Rex to scan the room to figure which frequency the dimension is, hoping to find out what happened to Levy.</p><p>The next day, Mark stops a burglary and asks Robot to keep him posted on the Levy situation. Mark arrives home to notice that his old room is being converted into a room for his child by Eve. Mark would then be visited by his father, and they head to the moon. Nolan reveals that he has exiled Thragg and that he worries more than ever about his family. Mark also reveals to him that Eve is pregnant with his child. Mark and Eve go to the moon base, now the home of Mark's parents. Eve mistakenly reveals that she is pregnant after Nolan asks Mark if she going to tell his wife. The four have dinner and Mark boasts about his newfound strength. After going back and forth, Mark and Nolan arm wrestle. Mark is able to hold his own for a while until he would notice Anissa watching outside. Mark heads into a Magmanite invasion lead by a newly powered Doctor Seismic and Volcanikka. He attempts to kill the giant monster but is stopped by Doctor Seismic. Doctor Sesmic attempts to incinerate Mark but only burns his costume. He throws Doctor Seismic off of him and rushes to the monster, only for it be killed. Mark flies to the sky and discovers that Anissa had slain it. Curious to know why, Mark cites that he noticed her watching his father and him arm wrestle. Anissa rebuffs and says that she was watching Mark instead of Nolan. She kisses Mark, much to his confusion, and flies off.</p><p>Mark goes home and Eve pleads with Mark not to go to after Angstrom.

Mohawk Mark says that Mark is one of the few good Marks, and suddenly Robot admits a pulse onto the duo, causing them intense pain. It is the same pulse that was used on Mark before. Robot kills the scientists and fires a grenade into Mohawk Mark's mouth, killing him. Robot then kills Angstrom to ensure that Mark has no way of returning back to his home dimension. Robot tells Mark that he doesn't want to kill him and instead decides to leave him stranded there.</p><h3>Ramifications</h3><p>Seeing the carnage and an alternate Kregg coming, Mark thinks of a plan. He switches costumes with the dead version of him and rips out his hair to make it look as if he is Mohawk Mark. Mark lies to Kregg and asks that he handle the Emperor duties until he finds a way to get out. He flies to the Teen Team base to see if an alternate version of Robot is there.</p><p>At first, the alternate Robot threatens to kill him, but Mark talks him down. He states that he is from another reality and wants his help. Alternate Robot reveals that Mark had killed Eve in his reality. Afterwards, Mark has Robot come into a lab with him to find a way to get him back home. Reluctant at first, Robot offers his assistance despite risking his death. Mark goes out to search for the Mauler twins and finds one that is still alive. Although they had a brief confrontation, Mark reveals to him that he is from another reality and thus didn't kill Mauler's brother. Mauler offers his help and they begin building a cloning machine so Robot could pose as the new Mark.</p><p>Mark asks the Viltrumites to not attempt to rescue him so he could cover Robot and Mauler aiding him. Months later, they finish the project and begin the cloning process. The Viltrumites unleash an alternate version of Monster Girl, who is physiologically an infant, because Robot never helped her dilemma. She transforms into an even larger monster, and Mark heads back home.</p><p>Mark arrives back at the old Teen Team base and flies back to his house. He arrives and is relieved to see Eve alive. Mark asks where Rudolph Conners is and what he told her. Eve replies that he said Mark was dead. Mark asks if she knows where Robot is, with no response again. Mark then asks about Eve\u2019s well-being. Eve states that she almost lost their child and that Mark being gone for six months caused her to not want to eat. Eve tells Mark what Robot said and Mark states that he lied. Not caring, Eve goes on to explain that raising her child without him was be the best option.</p><p>Mark notices that Eve isn\u2019t wearing her ring and Eve says that she cannot allow a child to live through a life, not knowing when or if its father is coming back. Mark attempts to explain to her that she was right about Angstrom, but Eve refuses to listen. Eve tells Mark that their relationship is over, much to Mark's sorrow. Mark begins to cry and Eve explains that his unreliability is the reason why. Mark asks that Eve leave to where she can\u2019t be found by Robot. He flies out of his house, crying and declaring his love for her. He is interrupted by the appearance of Anissa. She asks Mark where he has been, who does not want to talk to her.</p><p>Anissa tells Mark of the Viltrumite mission and how she isn\u2019t performing on her part. Mark attempts to leave but Anissa stops him, saying that she refuses to mate with humans, but will settle for Mark because he has Viltrumite DNA. Mark refuses her, flying away, but Anissa stops Mark by attacking him. Mark, not wanting to fight, asks her to leave him be. Anissa says she doesn\u2019t want to fight either, but cannot stall the mission any longer. Anissa attempts to seduce Mark, but he refuses her. Losing her patience, Anissa headbutts Mark and continues to assault him. Mark asks her to leave him alone, but she ignores him. Mark attacks Anissa, hoping to sway her away. However, she is enjoying their conflict. Anissa catches Mark\u2019s next punch, complimenting his strength. Anissa uses her superior strength and they land on unknown farm, with Anissa on top of Mark. She holds Mark\u2019s arms back, demanding that he stop resisting. Mark attacks her, demanding that she leave him alone. Anissa puts her elbow on neck, saying that she doesn\u2019t care.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8043901\" data-ratio=\"3.2\" data-width=\"600\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:320.0%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8043901\"><img alt=\"Anissa forces herself on Mark\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg 300w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Anissa forces herself on Mark\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg 600w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg 300w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043901-2ae9ed20-9091-42b6-97ab-97b11fe68f50.jpeg 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Anissa forces herself on Mark</figcaption></figure><p>Mark attempts to push Anissa off of him, but is unable to. Anissa tears off both of their costumes. Anissa then rapes Mark. Traumatized by the event, he begins to cry. Anissa demands that Mark \u201cman up\u201d and says that it will probably take a few more times, implying she will come back. She flies away, leaving a traumatized Mark to reflect. Mark receives some clothes from a farmer and flies off to the Pentagon.</p><p>Mark asks Cecil about Robot\u2019s location. Cecil reveals that they don\u2019t know and questions Mark. Robot arrives, and attempts to lie to Cecil, saying that Mark was killed. However, he sees through it and Robot transmits a pulse to de-power Mark for a bit. Robot slits Cecil\u2019s throat and crushes his skull. Mark, despite being in pain, destroys Robot\u2019s drone. Robot asks Mark to come to Mark's house. Mark flies there and notices that Robot's new drone is with Eve. Mark attempts to attack Robot\u2019s drone, but is blocked by another pulse.</p><p>Mark hits him, which only hurts himself in the process. Robot dismembers Eve\u2019s leg, after attaching a latch onto her. Mark bandages her leg and Robot fires a grenade. Mark escapes just in time to save Eve. Eve, after destroying Robot's drone, creates a force field to protect her from the vacuum of space, and the duo head to the Viltrumite Warship. Eve tells Mark worriedly that their baby might be in trouble now, and becomes unconscious. Mark asks his father to help him and Eve is put into surgery.

He grabs his daugther and holds her, crying. Sherry tells Mark that Eve won\u2019t have a human leg anymore. Mark says that he is happy that she is alive. After her surgery is over, Mark heads to see Eve, who asks to hold their child. He leaves to talk to his father and learns that Monster Girl is in surgery after attempting to fight Robot. Their conversation is interrupted by Anissa reporting to Nolan about Robot\u2019s drone. Mark shakes at the sight of her, and she whispers to him that she \u201cmissed him\u201d. Mark offers to help his father fight Rex, but Nolan suggests that he tend to Eve. Eve, having lost the weight gain immediately after childbirth, uses her power and rebuilds Mark's Invincible costume, and tells him to save the world.</p><p>Mark rushes to Robot\u2019s drone, but stops and wonders why the Viltrumites aren\u2019t attacking it. Anissa offers to help him up, but Mark smacks her hand away. Nolan intervenes and tells Mark that the Viltrumites have negotiated with Rex. Mark rushes to the Pentagon and confronts Rex in person. Rex attempts to reason with Mark for a long while. Rex finally gets through to Mark, who heads back to the moon. Mark informs Eve that Rex has actually won.</p><p>Mark heads to William and Rick\u2019s dorm, and William tells Mark all the good things that have been happening since Rex\u2019s takeover. After, Mark takes Eve to her parents' house and they have dinner with them. They meet Eve's daughter. The next day, Mark and Eve go to funerals of Black Samson, Knock-Out and Kid Thor, and Cecil\u2019s. Mark flies in the sky, only to be interrupted by the Immortal. The Immortal asks for Mark\u2019s help in stopping Rex. Mark goes on to say that Rex is doing the right thing, logically, no matter how evil it may seem. The Immortal points out that the world doesn\u2019t make sense, it never has, and it needs to stay that way. Touched by his word, Mark asks his father for help again. Nolan refuses again. Mark looks behind him and notices that Anissa is there. He grabs her throat and tells her to back off. Anissa tells him that she is enjoying this and says that it makes her want to \u201cspeed up their next encounter.\u201d</p><p>Mark lets her go and goes back to his house. Mark starts to daydream, but Eve gets his attention. He realizes that he won\u2019t be able stand aside and let Rex take over, but also takes into account that he is a father now. He suggest that they leave Earth instead so their child won\u2019t lose their father. Mark heads to the comic stores and buys some comics for the last time. He notices Amber Bennett, happy with another man. He smiles and leaves to find Rampage attacking. He saves the people in the vicinity and Rex\u2019s drones intervene. Rex attempts to reason with Mark and asks him to work with him. Mark flies off and meets D.A. Sinclair unexpectedly. Sinclair tells Mark that Rex isn\u2019t popular with the Global Defense Agency, and they might be able to fight Rex.</p><p>Mark heads to see The Immortal and Dupli-Kate at a safe-house. Believing Mark and Eve were aiding them, Immoral gets into an argument with Mark. Mark and Eve leave to go see a movie with William and Rick. That night, Eve would attempt to seduce Mark, but Mark refuses, still guilty over what happened with Anissa. The next day, Mark goes to eat with Art and Nolan. Afterwards, Mark says his goodbye to Nolan and goes to the moon to see his mother. Mark says his goodbye to his mom, and goes with Eve to the transport ship. During their journey, Eve decides to give their daughter a name, Terra. Mark agrees to it, saying it\u2019s a beautiful name, making another step to fatherhood.</p><h3>Fresh start</h3><p>Mark, Eve, and Terra arrive in Talescria. The trio is greeted by Allen, with two bodyguards beside him. Allen gets a closer look at Terra, commenting that she is cute. Terra punches Allen's eye and his bodyguards attempt to intervene. Eve puts up a force-field, but Allen stops his men from attacking first. Allen remembers that he has duty to attend to, and that someone else wants to meet them. Oliver arrives on the scene with a new appearance, and being much older. Oliver offers to cook dinner with his girlfriend. Allen leads Eve and Mark to their new house, and then leaves to resume his duties. While Eve changes Terra's diaper, Mark goes to ask Eve where to put her clothes. Afterwards, the two fall asleep with Terra. Eve wakes up to put Terra in her crib and attempts to get intimate with Mark. Mark panics and flies into a wall. Eve asks Mark if there's something wrong, only to be interrupted by the arrival of Oliver and his girlfriend, Haluma. They bring groceries in and Eve directs to the kitchen.</p><p>Mark and Oliver go to talk about Haluma. Oliver comments to Mark that her lobster-like appearance may seem strange, but that's what he's attracted to. Mark comments that he's happy for him. The four sit down for dinner and Oliver asks Mark to try the food. Mark takes a bite, surprised at how much he enjoys it. After dinner, an exhausted Mark falls asleep on the couch. The next morning, Mark goes to the bathroom to defecate what he ate. Eve knocks on the door and asks him if he's okay. Mark attempts to flush, but to no avail. Eve arrives with Mark, believing he broke something. Eve finds a button on the side and flushes it down. Mark heads to a window and Eve follows him. She holds his hand and they kiss. As they get intimate, Mark begins to cry, and a worried Eve wonders what's wrong again. Mark sits down and, with enough persistence from Eve, finally reveals that Anissa raped him. Mark goes on to say that it happened after Eve broke up with him.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8043905\" data-ratio=\"1.5372233400402\" data-width=\"1988\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1988px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:153.7%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8043905\"><img alt=\"Mark flying Eve and Terra to a hospital\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg 1988w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg 1249w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg 624w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg 416w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Mark flying Eve and Terra to a hospital\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg 1988w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg 1249w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg 624w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043905-e2bf1285-d869-47ec-9f0b-4b413f598dba.jpeg 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px\" data-width=\"416\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Mark flying Eve and Terra to a hospital</figcaption></figure><p>Eve attempts to comfort him but Mark pushes her away. Mark goes on to say that he refused her, and him holding back may have allowed it to happen. Mark ponders on the question and Eve begins to cry. Eve noticed that Terra had stopped breathing. Mark and Eve rushed her to a nearby hospital. They arrive and are asked to sign paperwork.</p><p>The doctor arrives and scans Terra, asking what species she is. Eve tells her that she is a Human/Viltrumite hybrid, which makes the doctor want to refuse her treatment. Mark demands that he does it anyone, and the scared doctor complies. They ask to go with him, but the doctor insists that they'll only be in the way. They wait in the lobby and Oliver arrives with Haluma.</p><p>Mark begins blaming Haluma's food. After a heated discussion as to the source of Terra's illness, Mark began crying in grief over the thought of losing her. Eve comes back from the emergency room to tell Mark that Terra is fine. The doctor tells them that the food she ingested caused her to be oxidized and since Viltrumites can hold their breath a long time, she didn't need to breathe. However, the doctor said that her not breathing caused the oxygen to not rush to her brain. Mark goes to Allen's office, who asks him if his superhero duties are over. Mark says yes, but Allen says that he must make some form of payments, since it exhausts Coalition funds. Allen remarks that he would let him stay here free of charge, were it up to him. Allen offers him a job as a spy for the Coalition. Mark is hesitant, but accepts. He arrives home and finds Eve cooking. Eve tells him that she must eat Geledarian food in order for Terra to be healthy, since the similarities are close to human food. After cleaning and eating, Eve finally talks to Mark about the Anissa situation. Eve asks that Mark doesn't blame himself about it and that they'll work through it together. Eve attempts to kiss Mark, but Mark backs away. They hear a knock on the door and Allen reveals that he doesn't think Battle Beast will win and ask Mark to finish Thragg off while he's weakened.</p><p>Mark and Oliver examine the aftermath of the battle between Thragg and Battle Beast on Thraxa. They cannot find either of them, but a local informs them that the flesh of Battle Beast was burned in a massive celebration. They return to their ship and later find Thresha, Battle Beast's girlfriend, and Space Racer floating around in a debris field in space. The two are given medical attention. Thresha breaks out of her stasis field and attacks the members on the ship, in a fit of rage over Battle Beast's death, but is eventually subdued. Mark returns home where he discusses the recent events with Eve. As the two get ready for bed, Eve claims that she wants to do more than just go to bed. She tells him that it's okay if he doesn't want to, but Mark says he wants to try.</p><p>Mark is awoken by Terra crying, and he goes to care for her. They spend a lot of time together, with Mark doing fatherly things like feeding her, getting thrown up on, playing with her, and reading to her. Mark tells him how much he cares for her, and that she is the best thing that has ever happened to him. He also tells her that if she comes home drunk, or destroys their vehicle that he will scold her, because that's his job. Eve wakes up to see Mark and Terra having some father-daughter time. Mark suggests they go out to eat and see the world. While walking in the park they see a young alien girl trying to get her \"cotha\" out of a tree. Mark saves the cotha, and the girl eats it alive. Mark tells himself and Eve that it's an alien planet, and Eve says that it won't let them forget. Mark hopes that Thragg got sucked into a black hole, unknowing of Thragg's actual condition.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8043907\" data-ratio=\"0.97845303867403\" data-width=\"1810\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1810px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:97.8%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8043907\"><img alt=\"Here we go again\u2026\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg 1810w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Here we go again\u2026\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg 1810w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8043907-e3f750d7-24d2-436d-baed-eafef9386718.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Here we go again\u2026</figcaption></figure><p>Over the next few weeks, Mark spends time with Eve and Terra as they adjust to life on Talescria. Mark and Oliver go on a job for the Coalition and find an illegal Kanslok farm. They fight a creature known as a Rynax. After defeating it, they report back to Allen, who tells them that Thragg has probably killed Space Racer. Mark, Oliver, and the Coalition decide to move in on Space Racer's last known location. When they arrive however, Thragg was gone. They start searching the planet. Mark enters a cave where he finds a creature emitting a blue light. Upon touching it, a flash of light blinds him, and the next thing he realized is <b>he was sitting on the toilet, reading Science Dog</b>, the same way he was before he had his powers.</p><h3>Temporal Reboot Timeline</h3><p>Mark progressed through the day with knowledge of everything that would happen. He approached Atom Eve and asked her about the Teen Team. She hadn't met him before and was shocked that he knew her secret identity. She dragged him to meet with the others. They were all in disbelief that he knew so much about them, yet they had never met him before. Over the next week, he told them how to win all of their future battles with David Hiles, the invading Flaxans, and the Mauler Twins.</p><p>Soon, Nolan noticed that Mark seemed depressed. He asked Mark what was going on. Mark took him outside and revealed that he had his powers. Nolan was elated. However, Mark told him he needed to promise that he truly loved him. Nolan said he did, of course. Then Mark asked him not to turn evil and invade Earth as he was secretly planning to. Nolan became angry and immediately attacked Mark. Mark led him to Utah where he tricked Nolan into smashing into the Guardians of the Globe headquarters. He revealed Nolan's plans to the Guardians and they subdued Nolan before he could kill them. Cecil Stedman soon arrived and brought Nolan back to the Pentagon to restrain him. However, upon waking up, Nolan pleaded that he was sorry, and that he felt regret for what he had done.</p><p>Later, Mark continued to save countless lives by knowing when the bad guys would strike and how. He saved Eve several times, but had to keep his distance as she was still dating Rex in the present timeline. One night Mark is once again approached by the mysterious entity. It offered him a chance to stay there and save lives, or return home. He decided to return home, as he couldn't bear to be away from his daughter. The entity was confused that he would trade countless lives for for one, but Mark confirmed his decision. Mark was brought back to his original timeline.</p><h3>Viltrumite war: Finale</h3><p>Mark learns that five years has passed since he experienced the \"reboot\". He flies back to Talescria, and discovers that Terra was now a small child instead of a toddler. Mark begins to weep about having lost precious time with his daughter, and asks for her forgiveness. She forgives him and they embrace. A sad Eve embraces him too. After putting Terra to bed, Mark and Eve discuss what happened during Mark's venture in time. He cries as he says that the many lives he saved are lost due to him choosing his daughter over them. Eve comforts him. They take Terra to school, and later they go to meet Allen. Allen embraces Mark and is joyous to see him. Mark asks about Oliver and Allen says that he is fine. Allen asks for Mark's help again to stop Thragg and Mark blatantly refuses. He goes to a party at Allen's house later and talks with Oliver. Mark watches the sky while others are mingling. Oliver asks how he is doing with Mark not recognizing him at first. Mark starts to cry and Oliver conforms him. The next day, Mark and Eve go on vacation with Mark being happy to have his family back. They arrive and Eve reveals that she was seeing someone while Mark was gone.</p><p>While talking with Eve about it, he says that he understands. Later, he tries to take Terra flying, but she gets scared. Mark later reads Terra a story. After they relax throughout the day, Mark and Eve think about what's happening on Earth since they haven't heard from Nolan in a while. They later visit Allen in the hospital after his attempted assassination. Later, Mark, Eve, and Terra visit Nolan and Debbie on the Moon, where Mark learns that Nolan and Rex have become friends. Anissa, having heard that Mark is back, tries to talk with him, but gets attacked by Eve and sent away by Nolan. Mark tells Eve later that he doesn't want his parents to know what she did to him.</p><p>Mark briefly goes to Earth where he and his father meet up with Rex. Rex tells Mark all the good he has accomplished in the last five years, and how everyone but Monster Girl and Monax are on his side. Rex has even managed to sway some villains, such as the Mauler Twins, by just giving them what they want, if their desires are reasonable enough. Mark talks to his father privately in outer space, where he says that he still cannot trust Rex after everything he's done. Nolan tries to convince Mark that Rex's leadership is a good thing, but to no avail. After saying goodbye to his parents on the Moon, Mark and his family leave. Mark reflects on how strange his life has been, which Eve misinterprets as him passing judgement on her affair with Kubian. Mark apologizes, even though Eve says that she should apologize because she was the one who did something wrong. When they get back to their new home planet, Mark asks Eve if she wouldn't mind hiding out there forever.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8015880\" data-ratio=\"0.47718309859155\" data-width=\"1775\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1775px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:47.7%\" href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-8015880\"><img alt=\"Eve knowing what needs to be done\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg 1775w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Eve knowing what needs to be done\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg 1775w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg 960w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11148/111484979/8015880-55b44a20-8098-4e18-9763-5523e79aab3c.jpeg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Eve knowing what needs to be done</figcaption></figure><p>Mark and his family are then attacked by Onaan and Ursaal, two of Thragg's new Thraxan-Viltrumite children and the only documented pair of Viltrumite twins. Onaan threatens Terra so Mark attacks him, while Eve takes off with their daughter. Mark then sees them being attacked by Ursaal, so he quickly takes down Onaan and flies to punch out the sister. Eve convinces Mark to take Terra as he can fly faster. Mark asks Terra to be brave while they fly very fast to get away from Onaan. Terra starts to have trouble breathing, so Mark is forced to slow down and fight Onaan. Onaan manages to get Terra away from Mark and drops her. After she falls out of sight, Mark manages to break away from Onaan and finds Eve fighting Ursaal. Mark knocks her into the ground, and Eve tells Mark that she thinks Terra is still alive. They manage to capture Onaan and find her next to Oliver's dead body and Thragg. Mark asks Thragg to let her go, and Thragg calls his bluff, saying heroes don't kill. Mark surprises Thragg by killing Onaan instantly, and in a blind fury Thragg rips Mark in half. Ursaal returns to severely injure Eve, before Thragg tells his daughter to let them die slowly. Once the two fly away, Eve uses her powers to heal both herself and Mark. Mark sees Oliver's dead body and changes his mind, saying he wants to defeat Thragg once and for all, and Eve agrees with him.</p><p>Soon enough, the team make preparations and move to different planets, stopping Thragg\u2018s children in the process, and convincing the leaders of each planet not to join Thragg\u2018s regime.</p><p>After a while, the empire and Allen\u2019s coalition move their ships near the Sun for preparation and to perhaps get help from Robot.

Shipping in March 2010, Invincible is prominently featured on the teaser cover of the first issue in front of a group of silhouetted characters covered in a classified information label. The website claims, \"This March the effects of IMAGE UNITED go global with a glimpse of the crossover's impact on INVINCIBLE and many other Image Comics favorites...\u201d</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p><em><strong>The extent of Invincible's powers had been unknown for a while but since he had since been revealed to be one of the (if not) the most powerful beings in his series.</strong></em></p><p><b>Super strength - </b>Invincible can press over 400 tons early on but has shown to be able to throw million ton Gollums past the the Moon at sub-light speeds and even fully resist and throw punches inside the Suns atmosphere (1.65 billion tonnes of force per square inch). Mark at EoS scales above Thragg who could overpower his old self (who had Island level strength) with one hand; negative difficulty. Shortly after his father was exiled from Earth he was able to help lift out of the water a 300,000 ton plus cruise liner. However his strength has increased exponentially since that was stated. As said by <a href=\"/conquest/4005-61561/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61561\"> Conquest</a> he is nearly as strong as even his father and is slated to surpass him in the future. Since this statement he has greatly surpassed his father, Omni-man. His strength is as such, that coupled with his speed he was able to <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/gen-discussion-1/viltrum-feat-finally-explained-2184063/\">destroy a planet</a>, which is many times the mass of Earth, by flying right through it and into its core with the aid of 2 other Viltrumites, they were also the cause of the massive entering and exit impacts at the bottom of the planet. After years of getting stronger, he was able to fight toe to toe with Thragg in the Sun, who previously made quick work of him and his father. After a 500 year time jump, he was able to best his old friend Allen the Alien who was previously much more powerful than him.</p><p><b>Invulnerability -</b> Like his Hero Name, Mark Grayson is Invulnerable to almost all harm. He can withstand the blasts of city-country level explosions with little to no damage. However, repeated punches of great force such as those from other <a href=\"/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\"> Viltrumites</a> can harm him over time. This invulnerability extends to mental domination and transmutation, however a certain virus has been seen to bypass this invulnerability and kill Viltrumites, leading to their small population. One of his best feats of durability is surviving a planetary explosion of the planet <a href=\"/viltrum/4020-56525/\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56525\"> Viltrum</a> even when he himself was near the epicentre of the actual blast in the centre of the planet. One of his other overlooked durability feats is being unaffected by a custom-made nuclear weapon which made the largest solar flare ever recorded (at least 80 billion megatons).</p><p><b>Flight -</b> Like his father, Mark can also fly. He was once said to be able to fly from earth to Mars in only a few days. However he has been shown to have increased his flight speed since then. It is now known that his flying speed is superior to his <a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\"> father</a>'s who was able to fly from Earth to a different star-cluster in 2 weeks (on one breathe of air) which entrails moving millions upon million times the speed of light. <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/forums/gen-discussion-1/invincible-comic-is-1-billion-x-ftl-revised-2228784/\">He was even able to casually outspeed a ship that can go billions of times Faster than Light.</a></p><p><strong>Super speed - </strong><span>Mark, like all </span><a href=\"/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\">Viltrumites</a><span> possess the ability to think, move and perceive events at super speed. They can move at such speeds coupled with their slowed down perception to move freely whilst time looks to come to a halt. On average, he can move at sub-relativistic speeds but once he speeds up, he can perceive events at near-light or FTL speeds. An example is when he, his </span><a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\">father</a><span> and </span><a href=\"/thaedus/4005-55384/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55384\">Thaedus</a><span> keep up with </span><a href=\"/space-racer/4005-74962/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-74962\">Space Racer</a><span>\u2019s infinity ray in which their perception speed is dilated to these speeds. He normally doesn\u2019t utilise this much as he needs to hold back against weak Earth villains to not kill them, and holding back makes him massively slower.</span></p><p><b>Healing -</b> Mark is able to recover from injuries more efficiently and quickly that would otherwise be fatal to someone with a normal human healing rate.</p><p><strong>Endurance -</strong> Mark is able to endure extreme physical trauma that would otherwise kill a normal person, such as numerous broken bones, skull fractures, and even disembowelment. On one such occasion he has continues fighting even after been impaled by a fist through his abdomen and having his guts ripped out of his body (though he's passed out shortly after)</p><p><b>Lung Capacity -</b> While he cannot breath in space he is able to hold his breath long enough to fight and travel long distances without a space suit. Mark can also hold his breath under water for long periods of time. In his early days he could survive hours or a day without air. However his lung capacity is now comparable to that of an adult <a href=\"/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\"> Viltrumite</a> as his father has shown it is possible for a one to survive at LEAST 1 week on a single breathe of air. He also appears to be unaffected by the vacuum or radiation of space.</p><p><b>Longevity -</b> Mark also has an expanded life span like a Viltrumite. The longer he lives the slower he ages. It is not known how long his life span is but it is known he will live for thousands of years. He has since lived for more than 500 years whilst his appearance looks like that of a 30-40 year old man.</p><h2><b>Other Media</b></h2><h3><strong>Film</strong></h3><p>Paramount pictures recently said that they have plans for an Invincible movie in the near future. They would like for Robert Kirkman to write the screenplay. There is no scheduled release date but rumors say that it will be released some time in 2009, or 2010. Unfortunately nothing came of it and the rights to Invincible were reverted back to Robert Kirkman.</p><p>In April 2017, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg have been set to write, direct and produce a feature film adaptation of <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\"><em>Invincible</em></a>, the Image/Skybound Entertainment comic series from <em>The Walking Dead</em>\u2018s <a href=\"/robert-kirkman/4040-40977/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40977\">Robert Kirkman</a>, Ryan Ottley &amp; Cory Walker. The film will come under Kirkman\u2019s first-look deal with Universal Pictures where he will also serve as a producer alongside Rogen and Goldberg.</p><h3><strong>Digital Show</strong></h3><p>MTV started a digital TV show of Invincible which is basically an animated comic book; it is available on iTunes.</p><h3><strong>Animated Series</strong></h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7888534\" data-ratio=\"0.56240822320117\" data-width=\"681\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 681px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7888534\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.jpg\" data-srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.png 681w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.jpg 320w\"><noscript><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.png 681w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11128/111289131/7888534-invinciblre.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></noscript></a></figure><p>Invincible is an animated series based on the comic Invincible.

Norse times a blacksmith from Scandinavian was visited by the thunder god Thor after his hammer Mjolnir was misplaced and asked if the blacksmith could build him a new one until Mjolnir was found. The hammer impressed Thor so much that he enchanted the new hammer and returned to the blacksmith so that only he and his future relatives could use it. The hammer was passed on from generation to generation until it found its way to Kid Thor, which he uses to fight crime with Capes, Inc.</p><p><b>Invincible War:</b></p><p>Kid Thor, along with other Capes members, answered the call when versions of Invincible from other dimensions attacked the planet. Once he and the other Capes members found the original Invincible, they teamed up and started to thin out the chaos that was happening to the planet. After the war ended, Kid Thor, along with the other super hero teams, Capes, and Youngblood, helped with the clean up job. When Invincible was attacked by the villain known as Powerplex, Kid Thor rushed to save him, but was stopped by his teammate, as Youngblood was already helping with the situation.</p><h2>Death</h2><p>Kid Thor is one of the superheroes caught in a fight against one of <a href=\"/robot/4005-41166/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41166\">Robot</a>'s latest model of drones when Robot initiated his assassination of the threats to his attempts in creating a \"utopia\" alongside <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/knockout/4005-1394/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1394\">Knockout</a>, <a href=\"/pegasus/4005-76660/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-76660\">Pegasus</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/yeti/4005-70085/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-70085\">Yeti</a>. Kid Thor's hand was destroyed and is killed soon afterwards by a blast from Robot before being revived by Knockout who placed Kid Thor's hammer onto his corpse. After the initial shock of seeing his injured hand, Kid Thor attempts to attack Robot in retaliation after seeing Robot kill Knockout by cutting her head in half. Robot catches Kid Thor's hammer and destroys it. Kid Thor is presumed to be killed in the explosion afterwards while Pegasus and Yeti escaped the site of battle.       </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><figure data-ref-id=\"1300-4686061\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111240963/4686061-4151141-invincible%2B112%2B%282014%29%2B%28digital%29%2B%28darkness-empire%29%2B010mm.jpg\" data-size=\"medium\" data-align=\"right\" data-ratio=\"0.69817073170732\" data-width=\"656\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 656px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:69.8%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11124/111240963/4686061-4151141-invincible%2B112%2B%282014%29%2B%28digital%29%2B%28darkness-empire%29%2B010mm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-4686061\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111240963/4686061-4151141-invincible%2B112%2B%282014%29%2B%28digital%29%2B%28darkness-empire%29%2B010mm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11124/111240963/4686061-4151141-invincible%2B112%2B%282014%29%2B%28digital%29%2B%28darkness-empire%29%2B010mm.jpg 656w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11124/111240963/4686061-4151141-invincible%2B112%2B%282014%29%2B%28digital%29%2B%28darkness-empire%29%2B010mm.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Kid Thor's enchanted hammer lets him combat foes that are bigger than him because of its size and can only be wielded up by him.

"Knockout is currently a member of the Guardians of the Globe, representing Canada's interests in the team. Her powers stem from a pair of special boxing gloves that grant her superhuman strength and durability.", "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>During the Great Depression the super-villain who called himself \u201cThe Boxer\u201d attempted to rob an bank in Atlanta order to make ends meet. The robbery was going exactly as he planned until the hero, Thor Man, entered the scene. The two men battled briefly, until one of the Boxer\u2019s gloves came loose. Even as the boxing glove fell from his hand, Thor Man struck a decisive blow directly into the middle of the Boxer\u2019s chest.</p><p>What Thor Man didn\u2019t realize, was that the Boxer\u2019s gloves were the source of his invulnerability and with them gone he was nothing more than a simple man. As a result, Thor Man\u2019s strike crushed the Boxer\u2019s chest; killing him instantly. Horrified and distracted by the carnage his hammer just wrought, Thor Man didn\u2019t notice when the security guard who had been guarding the bank at the time, surreptitiously stole the gloves and slipped away with them.</p><p>The security guard initially hoped to sell the gloves in order to make ends meet but eventually found that he risk them falling into the wrong hands. He even wore them himself for a time, taking on the name of the Boxer himself and fighting crime when necessary.</p><p>Decades later, the guard\u2019s grand-daughter found the gloves secreted away in his home and asked about their history. Then an old man, the guard told her of the gloves checkered past and when she asked for them, he happily passed them on to her.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief following her first appearance on to the superhero scene, Knockout is actually flat-chested, but during the time she was employed by Capes Inc, she wore a pair of prosthetic breast enhancements as part of her superhero costume because, in her words, \"the world just doesn't want flat-chested superheroines\". Apparently this held true for her employers, as her salary did indeed double after she started wearing them.</p><p>When the Guardians of the Globe held a membership drive after Invincible left Earth to fight in the Viltrumite War, Knockout and her teammate/boyfriend Kid Thor were selected to become Canada's representatives on the Guardians of the Globe. She has been part of the fights against The Walking Dread and the new War Woman, both of The Order. After joining the Guardians, she stopped wearing her prosthetics altogether, and apparently hold no shame at being flat-chested, possibly because people actually like a superheroine that breaks the mold and shows the world that you don't need to look like someone else's idea of beauty to be a superhero.</p><p>Recently, she found herself on the receiving end of Outrun's romantic advances, something that visibly unnerved her. She hadn't expected the speedster to be so forward, and rebuffed her, which in turn caused Outrun to call her both \"uptight\" and \"old-fashioned.\" Knockout responded in annoyance by referring to herself as a \"one-partner-at-a-time type,\" but had her thought cut short by Ms. Popper, who had teleported in to the Guardian's HQ to ask for their assistance in a situation that Best Tiger, Kaboomerang, Japandroid, and Samson were dealing with in Kuwait. Both heroines were more than happy to agree and joined the fray, ready to blow off some steam by busting heads.</p><p>Despite the constant risks, Kid Thor and Knockout seemed to thrive among their teammates and come out of their insane battles relatively unscathed. That is, until Kid Thor faced the mad god Thoth in India.</p><p>Thoth murdered Kid with casual ease during their battle. When his remains were returned to the Guardians\u2019 headquarters in Utah, Knockout wept over his corpse until she inadvertently resurrected him when she placed his magical hammer onto his chest.</p><p>Kid\u2019s miraculous resurrection, and the insane events of their lives, caused Knockout to re-evaluate their relationship status. She now wants to marry Kid as soon as possible, in order to never be apart from her lover.</p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Knockout is a capable pugilist; presumably she has received some form of formal training in American Style Boxing.</p><h2>Weapons and Equipment</h2><p>Knockout employs a unique pair of boxing gloves in combat. Through some unknown method be it technological or magical, the gloves grant their wearer the ability to strike physical objects with superhuman force in addition to a measure of invulnerability. Knockout has never measured the maximum force she can generate from a single punch.</p><p> </p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url":

She is actually an adult, but everytime she transforms she gets younger, so she looks like a child now.", "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The young woman who would become Monster Girl was a bright yet crass student who attended an expensive girl's school. She skipped a few grades and was set to graduate at a young age when her senior class took a trip to Europe that would change her life.</p><p>On the trip she met a cute, young gypsy boy and was swept up in a whirlwind of romance. The boy's disapproving grandmother saw the two young lovers during a romantic rendezvous and cast a gypsy curse upon her grandson's paramour. On the flight back to the States, the curse began to take effect. She hid in the toilet as her body uncontrollably morphed into a monstrous troll-like being.</p><p>At first she was terrified, but she soon gained control of her trasformations. She put her powerful creature body to good use as the heroine Monster Girl.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Monster Girl was created by <a data-ref-id=\"4040-40977\" href=\"/robert-kirkman/4040-40977/\" slug=\"robert-kirkman\">Robert Kirkman</a>, her first appearance was in Invincible #9.</p><h2>History</h2><p>After a while, Monster Girl began to notice an adverse physiological effect to her powers. The more she transformed into the creature, the larger and stronger her monster form became-but her human body became younger. She tried to use her powers less, but there was always some crisis that required the attention of her monstrous alter-ego. Monster Girl physically grew younger, but mentally she remained an adult woman of twenty nine. Depressed about her condition, Monster Girl began recklessly using her powers, heedless of the damage she was doing to herself.</p><p>When Monster Girl tried out for the new <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-globe\">Guardians of the Globe</a>, she had the body of a thirteen year old girl. The bizarre disconnect between her childlike appearance and her somewhat randy adult behavior made some of her teammates uncomfortable, but Monster Girl proved to be a great asset to the Guardians in the field. <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41166\" href=\"/robot/4005-41166/\" slug=\"robot\">Robot</a> committed to helping Monster Girl find a cure for her state, but as of yet claims to have no success.</p><p>To mitigate the de-aging process, Monster Girl wore a suit of high-tech battle armor so that she could still participate on missions in her original form without having to trasform into her monster form. The armor was originally designed for <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41129\" href=\"/black-samson/4005-41129/\" slug=\"black-samson\">Black Samson</a> after he lost his superpowers. When Samson was seriously injured by <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41126\" href=\"/battle-beast/4005-41126/\" slug=\"battle-beast\">Battle Beast</a> and rendered comatose, Monster Girl donned his armor. The batttel with <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55178\" href=\"/omnipotus/4005-55178/\" slug=\"omnipotus\">Omnipotus</a> required that Monster Girl change into the hulking creature, destroying the suit in the process.</p><p>The young clone of Robot has stated that Monster Girl's ability to cope with her own debilitating condition is what inspired him to find a way to leave the confines of his former self's isolated life-support chamber. Monster Girl told Robot that she felt it was very creepy if Robot had given himself a human body in order to be with her. Robot assured her that wasn't the case, but the two quickly started a romantic relationship regardless. She told Robot she loved him during Rex Splode's funeral. Monster Girl and Robot are currently stranded in an alternate dimension, hoping to find a permanent way to keep inter-dimensional aliens from invading Earth.</p><h2>Character Information</h2><h3><b>Human Form:</b></h3><p><b>Height:</b> 4' 10\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 90 lbs</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Brown</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</p><h3><b>Monster Form:</b></h3><p><b>Height:</b> 12'</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 2,800 lbs</p><p><b>Hair:</b> None</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> White</p><p><b>Strength level:</b> Monster Girl possesses superhuman strength, allowing her to lift in excess of 60 tons. If she continues using her powers transforming into monster form, it is conceivable that her strength level will increase in proportion to her increase in size. In human form, she possesses the strength of a girl her age, build and height who engages in regular exercise.</p><h2><b>Known superpowers</b></h2><p>As a result of the gypsy curse placed on her, Monster Girl possesses the supernatural ability to transform herself from human female to a substantially larger, stronger, and more resilient humanoid-like male form. This change adds over 2,700 lbs of bone mass and tissue to her body by utilizing smart atoms to alter the normal movement of the quarks and gluons of her body's atoms, increasing or decreasing their mass as required. Her body is immune to most forms of conventional injury, including extremes in temperature and pressure, open flame, severe cold, radiation, and concussive forces (such as impacts and explosions). At first, Monster Girl had no control over her transformations, which would occur at random. Later, she learned to initiate the change into monster form through a conscious act of will. The metamorphosis between one aspect and another generally occurs in a matter of seconds.</p><p>The adverse side effect of the curse is that her human form's physiological makeup is altered every time she changes into monster form. When Monster Girl changes, her DNA recreates the altered body form based on her current age. An error in her DNA coding means that her human age is underestimated and her monster age is overestimated. The more she assumes her monster persona, the younger her human form becomes upon reverting back again. Conversely, the younger her human self becomes, her monster form grows in both strength and stature. Her brain is not affected when the rest of her body changes, so it continues to develop as a normal human of her calender age. Originally, both forms were roughly equal in size, but continued use of her powers have resulted in Monster Girl's human form regressing in physical age and appearance to that of a pre-teen, when in reality she has the life experience, demeanor and mental processes of a twenty nine year old woman. Her monster persona has consequently increased in strength and size.</p><p>Monster Girl's powers can be seen as a limited form of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55381\" href=\"/martians/4060-55381/\" slug=\"martians\">Martian</a> shapeshifting (in this case only 2 body forms are possible) and an even more limited form of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40947\" href=\"/atom-eve/4005-40947/\" slug=\"atom-eve\">Atom Eve</a>'s molecular rearranging powers (remembering and recreating clothing)</p><h2>Equipment</h2><p>For a time, Monster Girl utilized Black Samson's battle armor to augment her natural strength, foregoing her transformation into monster form in an attempt to lessen her age regression. The suit was modified by Robot for her use. It was destroyed in a battle with Omnipotus. She wears a belt made for her by Robot which keeps her from growing younger and has permanently solved her aging problem.</p><h2>Alternate Versions</h2><p>In another reality she goes by an alias Monstrous Girl and is a member of <a data-ref-id=\"4060-56490\" href=\"/emperors-elite/4060-56490/\" slug=\"emperors-elite\">Emperor's Elite</a>.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105539/", "id": 105539, "name": "Perfect Strangers, Part 1", "issue_number": "9"}, "gender": 2, "id": 41162, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/13/134753/4151080-4959a.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-677341/", "id": 677341, "name": "Volume 3", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-compendium-3-volume-3/4000-677341/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-674061/", "id": 674061, "name": "Volume 12", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-12-volume-12/4000-674061/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-664333/", "id": 664333, "name": "The End of All Things Part Two", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-the-end-of-all-things-2-the-end-of-all-/4000-664333/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-660042/", "id": 660042, "name": "The End of All Things Part Twelve", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-144-the-end-of-all-things-part-twelve/4000-660042/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-638638/", "id": 638638, "name": "The End of All Things Part Ten; Robot War!", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-142-the-end-of-all-things-part-ten-robo/4000-638638/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-589852/", "id": 589852, "name": "Volume Twenty-Three", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-full-house-1-volume-twenty-three/4000-589852/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-546076/", "id": 546076, "name": "", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-130/4000-546076/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-508474/", "id": 508474, "name": "Reboot?

They achieved a what they term a utopia by culling the weaker from their own numbers, leaving a race of conquerors bent on bringing new worlds under their control, subjugating weaker civilizations. Races who failed to submit to the Viltrumites were attacked and in some cases wiped from existance.</p><p>Nolan had pursued greatness among the Viltrumites, working arduously to earn a position on the conquering committee. He was stationed on the frontier of the expanding empire, helping conquer numerous worlds, as well as undertaking solo missions such as hunting down the \"infinity ray\" weapon. Excelling at his work, Nolan received accolades for his brutality and efficiency and was soon promoted to lead his own division.</p><p>Omni-Man is a <a href=\"../../viltrumites/65-54662/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Viltrumite</a> sent to Earth to conquer it, but started a family instead. He married a woman he saved and had a son, Mark Grayson, <a href=\"../../invincible/29-5210/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Invincible</a>. Knowing that his wife and son would not accept him for who he really was and what his real reasons for coming to earth were, he changed his story from one of conquest to one of peace bringer.</p><p>Omni-Man, going by the name Nolan Grayson, became an author to make money and when he wasn't writing, he was protecting the planet as Omni-Man with the aid of a government official named <a href=\"../../cecil/29-55964/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cecil</a>. After he had learned his son Mark, had developed his super powers, he helped Mark understand how to use these new powers and the told him that he would get stronger but only by pushing himself physically. Omni-Man and Invincible at times also worked together.</p><p>Omni-Man knowing that he had strayed from his goals set in motion the plan of weakening earths defenses by killing former friends The <a href=\"../../guardians-of-the-globe/65-41091/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Guardians of the Globe</a>. Do to the work of GG's enemies, the member of Guardians of the Globe <a href=\"../../the-immortal/29-41141/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Immortal</a> was brought back to life with the intent of controlling him. He did not fall under there control though and proceeded to go after Omni-Man intent on revenge. Mark arrived to help his father with a rescue only to arrive just as he killed Immortal for the second time. Omni-Man proceeded to tell Mark the truth of his past and why he had been sent to Earth. Mark would not believe that his father was a cold blooded killer and confronted him instead, not willing to join in part of conquering or destroying earth.</p><p>They fought and Omni-Man beat his son nearly to death. Seemingly unable to kill his own son he left the planet, and started another family on another world. He contacted his son some time later and invited him to the planet where he was living. There he revealed that he had another son, for on this planet the beings that lived there grew much faster, so in the few months he was away he had had a child that was now a toddler. It was at this point that several other Viltrumites appeared and attempted to capture Omni-Man. Mark was forced to leave (taking his half brother back to Earth with him) and abandon his father who is currently a prisoner of the Viltrumites, his own people. The last thing Omni-Man said to his son was, \"Read my books.\" When Mark was teaching his half brother how to fly, on Earth, he had to explain to him that everyone on Earth hated Omni-Man, but he didn't belive it.</p><p>While in Prison, Allen the Alien (who had gotten himself incarcerated) hatched an escape plan with Omni-man. On the day his execution was to be carried out Allen busted himself free and also freed the Battle beast along with Omni-Man they killed the two Viltrumite excutioners.</p><h2>Preparations for the Viltrumite war</h2><p>In this two issue mini with artist Cory Walker, Kirkman focuses on Allen, and Nolan. Allen and Nolan have just escaped from the Viltrumite prison in which they were being held captive. Their primary focus is going to certain parts of the universe, and finding things that can hurt the Viltrumites. Nolan (having been on many adventures himself) knows what can hurt them. It is also noted that there was a virus produced by rebels of the Viltrumite empire which was successful in killing a large number of them and in turn leaving an extremely small population of Viltrumites alive. It seems the reason they need to inhabit earth is because they can successfully re-breed their population there.</p><p>Nolan's novels are are actually brought to life when Allen discovers that the Space Racer (a man Nolan supposedly killed) is still alive. He has a special type of weapon that returns to him automatically when touched by other individual. Nolan and Allen try to save him by digging him out of the rubble. Finally the Space Race is exposed and tries to kill Nolan. When Space Racer tries to kill Nolan, Nolan explains that he has switched sides. Space Racer doesn't believe him at first, but Allen then reassures him and he agrees to play a role in the upcoming war.</p><p>He then returns to Earth searching for his son and Tech Jacket. After finally founding them both, he decided to bring Oliver too this mission also. In the middle of the vastness of space they all get attack by Conquest.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>We know that Nolan is the comic's version of Superman and like the Man of Steel, he's from another world. He's ridiculously strong, fast, durable, and can fly. Nolan's ability to heal from injuries comes in handy when taking on other Viltrumites such as Thragg, Anissa, and the others. The former superhero has some very strong DNA inside him, the dude can override the genetics of whoever he produces an child with (explaining why Oliver looks so much like him). His power to fly can get him travelling through outer space in a matter of seconds. Being in space and stuff, he can hold his breath for as long as two weeks in order to remain active. Nolan's a pretty good fighter, judging by what he did to his son and a few other enemies of his, you DO NOT want to get on his bad side.</p><p><b>Super-strength:</b> Omni-Man possesses the vast superhuman strength of a Viltrum male of his size, stature and age. He can lift in excess of 1,000,000,000 tons, his upper limits are unknown although he has been shown to be able to match Mean Supreme in strength.</p><p><b>Flight:</b> It is speculated that Omni-Man flies by means of manipulating gravitons thereby negating the force of gravity, enabling him to fly at speeds rivaling starships. While in earth he usually moves at Mach speeds, but outside the atmosphere he can easily move massively faster than light.</p><p><b>Invulnerability:</b> His skin is capable to withstand great heat without blistering, great cold without freezing, and great impact without injury, with the assistance of Invincible and Thaedus he was able to destroy planet Viltrum by flying through it.</p><p><b>Self Sustenance:</b> Can survive long periods (weeks) without food, water or rest. He can survive unprotected in the vacuum of space or at the deepest ocean depths for as long as he is capable of holding his breath. Omni-Man has stated that on at least two accasions, he held his breath for as long as two weeks with only one gulp of air in his lungs.</p><p><b>Reflexes:</b> At least on subliminal speed as he is able to navigate and process information even while travelling at high speeds.</p><p><b>Healing:</b> He has exceptional recuperative powers, endurance and is highly resistant to most conventional froms of injury, on the off chance something can hurt him is Viltrum physiology allows him to recover from physical damage at an extremely accelerated rate.</p><p><b>Extended Lifespan:</b> The Viltrum have exremely long life spans and Nolan has indicated that he has lived well over two millennia as time is measured on Earth.</p><h2>Personal Info</h2><p><b>Past Occupations:</b> Adventurer, world conqueror, superhero, author</p><p><b>Current Occupation:</b> Member of the Coalition of Planets, protector of the universe</p><p><b>Identity Status:</b> Nolan's family knows of his alien identity Noolan, superheroes of the earth know him as Nolan Grayson, the public knows him as Omni-Man</p><p><b>Legal status:</b> Citizen of Viltrum, now traitor, citizen of the U.S, now fugitive.</p><p><b>Place of birth:</b> Viltrum</p><p><b>Marital status:</b> Widow, divorced</p><p><b>Known relatives:</b> Andressa (mate, deceased), Deborah Grayson (ex-wife.former widow, current girlfriend), Mark Grayson (son), Oliver (son)</p><p><b>Group affiliations:</b> Formerly Guardians of the Globe ally (never a member), Coalition of Planets.</p><p><b>Base of operation:</b> Formerly Viltrum, and Mantis world.

Outrun is from South Africa.", "description": "<p>Outrun made a name for herself as a superhero in South Africa. Becoming somewhat of an Idol, she is approached by an organization called the Guardians of the Globe. With her candid and speedy personality, she accepted their offer to join the organization when soon after her body is taken over by a villain named \"Embrace\". Embrace, who has the power to possess fellow humans, possessed Outrun and fed information to the Guardians of the Globe's evil counterpart, \"The Order\". Being taken over, she was a helpless spectator in her own body. Embrace initiated several sexual encounters between Outrun and male members of the Guardians, as Outrun was forced to watch. Because of Outrun's previous flirtatious and outgoing nature, none of her colleagues realized what had happened to her, until Best Tiger noticed very minuscule changes and decided that Outrun hadn't been acting herself for a while. He decides to confront her and he ultimately frees Outrun from Embrace's control and forces Embrace to flee.</p><h2><strong>Powers and Abilities</strong></h2><p>Outrun's most notable power is her superhuman speed. Although her top speed is unknown, she has been shown running on water, and was also able to run from New York to Iowa in mere seconds. Her quick thinking and effective tactical retreats have often set the groundwork for efficient counterattacks. She has skilled perception skills and when fighting Gorgg was able to tell that he Kaboomerang was using telekinesis powers to make his boomerangs hit the mark, and not just pure skill.</p>",

How he got his ability of super-speed is a mystery. It is possible he was born a mutant, or that he was a test subject for genetic engineering experiments by the Russian or soviet government, or that he was mutated through exposure to intense radiation from a nuclear accident, such as the Chernobyl disaster. Possibly, he simply received his powers through a one in a million freak accident.</p><p>Creating a masked identity for himself, the Red Rush became Russia's greatest crimefighter, based in the nation's capital, Moscow. The name of his costumed persona is derived from his red costume and superhuman speed. The American news media translated his Russian alias as Red Rush, as a pun on his national origins: he was a rushing Russian. (The color red was also popularly associated with Communism in the Soviet era.)</p><p>The Red Rush accumulated a rogues gallery of colorful costumed adversaries, such as <a href=\"/kursk/4005-42570/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42570\">Kursk</a>, who repeatedly tried and failed to elaborate efforts to capture and kill him.</p><p>In his true identity, the Red Rush was romantically involved with a patient, loving woman whose has not been reveled. It is not known whether they were married or not. She knew his dual identity and was fondly tolerant of his insistence on squeezing as much crimefighting at super-speed into his day as possible. (She was known to joke that sometimes she wished he was a slowpoke who never got anywhere on time, instead.)</p><p>The Red Rush's fame spread far beyond Russia, and he became a member of Earth's leading team of superhuman champions, the original <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">Guardians of the Globe</a>. The Red Rush's amazing career came to a sudden stop when he was betrayed and murdered by his ally <a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\">Omni-Man</a>..</p><p> </p><h2>Powers and Abilities</h2><p>Red Rush possessed the superhuman capability to move at great speeds. He was able to alter the composition of his atoms in such a way as to affect his body's ability to travel at fantastic velocities. Red Rush appeared able to mentally control this on a bodily level, so that (for example) all his atoms could be given a net gain in inertia in just one direction. This allowed him to move his entire body at great speeds simply by willing it. His body was particularly sturdy, resilient to the stresses and effects of high speed travel. The extreme strengthening of normal physical processes was due to subtle changes in mass and energy within each atom of his body. His ability to breathe normally while moving at greaat speeds was achieved via smart atoms creating a protective barrier around him that compensated for changes in pressure and resistance while actively altering oxygen molecules for normal absorption into his body, which enabled Red Rush to travel at speeds of well over 400 mph and maintaining them for hours at a time without any adverse effects. The Red Rush's practical reaction times were about 10 times faster than an Olympic level athlete, and the speed at which his brain processed information was heightened to a level equaling his bodily speed, enabling him to perceive his surroundings while traveling at high velocities.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105537/", "id": 105537, "name": null, "issue_number": "7"}, "gender": 1, "id": 42573, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11/111746/5904065-72_12.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-508474/", "id": 508474, "name": "Reboot?

After meeting Atom Eve, Rex turned over a new leaf and became the superhero Rex-Splode. He was a former member of the Teen Team, and later became a member of the new Guardians of the Globe.", "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>As a child, Rex was born into a poor family. Relief came eventually in the form of a government agent. The man offered his family a life of luxury in exchange for Rex. The deal was made and Rex was taken. Rex was made into a soldier. he was trained in gymnastics and fighting and was put through experiments to alter his body including giving him increased strength and the ability to charge inorganic materials. He was used as an agent and was sent to places as a terrorists of sorts. All seemed fine until one day he decided to escape. It might have been a longing to meet his true family and that's exactly what he did as soon as he was clear. He found his family prosperous with young girls. This devastated him and he became secluded. Eventually he met up with <a href=\"/robot/4005-41166/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41166\">Robot</a> and formed the <a href=\"/teen-team/4060-41090/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41090\">Teen Team</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>Rex was created by <a href=\"/robert-kirkman/4040-40977/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40977\">Robert Kirkman</a>, his first appearance was in Invincible #2.</p><h2>An Invincible Ally</h2><p>Rex-Splode was one of the first heroes <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a> met along with the rest of the Teen Team during a fight with the <a href=\"/mauler-twins/4005-41202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41202\">Mauler Twins</a>. Invincible thought he was a jerk and had a hard time getting along with him especially because they both had feelings for teammate, <a href=\"/atom-eve/4005-40947/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40947\">Atom Eve</a>, whom Rex was with. Their relationship was short lived however when Eve found Rex with fellow teammate <a href=\"/dupli-kate/4005-41136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41136\">Dupli-Kate</a>. This angered Invincible, but eventually they became friends</p><p>When the original <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">Guardians of the Globe</a> were killed, Rex decided to try to get into the team. When he was at the member drive he got in a fight with future teammate <a href=\"/monster-girl/4005-41162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41162\">Monster Girl</a> because of her appearance. With Robot as team leader Rex was granted membership as long as he behaves. He coasted with the team and enjoyed his relationship until one day he came into HQ and found Dupli-Kate with <a href=\"/the-immortal/4005-41141/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41141\">The Immortal</a> much in the same way Eve found her and Rex. During one of the team meetings <a href=\"/cecil/4005-42576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42576\">Cecil</a> revealed the real Robot, a young boy who looked remarkably similar to Rex. Robot explained that his body was not sufficient so he made a younger clone of Rex as a replacement body.</p><p>During the Sequid's attack on Earth, Rex, <a href=\"/shrinking-ray/4005-42575/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42575\">Shrinking Ray</a>, and Kate were all benched because they could be used as hosts for the Sequids. However, during the rest of the team's time in space the <a href=\"/lizard-league/4060-49628/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49628\">Lizard League</a> attacked a nuclear missile base. The remaining team went to confront the league and appeared to have the upper hand by killing <a href=\"/salamander/4005-49631/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49631\">Salamander</a> and <a href=\"/iguana/4005-49630/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49630\">Iguana</a>, but the strongest member, <a href=\"/komodo-dragon/4005-49632/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49632\">Komodo Dragon</a>, turned the table by killing Shrinking Ray and apparently Dupli-Kate and all her clones. Rex sacrificed his hand to put an explosive in his head, killing him. Rex thought he won until <a href=\"/king-lizard/4005-49629/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49629\">King Lizard</a> pulled a gun on him. Rex fought it out and ended up getting shot in the head. Luckily King Lizard passed out when he did and <a href=\"/brit/4005-5212/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5212\">Brit</a> showed up to take them away. Rex was able to heal and got a robotic, replacement hand that shot explosive projectiles.</p><p>These events seemed to have matured Rex emotionally. He takes his activities as a superhero more seriously. Upon hearing of Invincible and Atom Eve's new relationship, Rex sincerely wishes them well, much to Eve's surprise. After Invincible leaves the government, Rex along with Robot, Monster Girl, and Bulletproof leave the Guardians of the Globe to reform the Teen Team.</p><p>In order to save his team from an Invincible from an alternate universe, Rex blows himself up so they have time to escape, destroying himself and the Invincible.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>Rex-Splode has the ability to alter the chemical makeup of inorganic materials, causing them to become unstable and explode. He has limited invulnerability and slightly enhanced strength. After his hand was bitten off by a member of the Lizard League, Rex received an artificial hand that can fire exploding projectiles.</p><h2>Alternate Realities</h2><p>During Invincible's fight with <a href=\"/angstrom-levy/4005-41203/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41203\">Angstrom Levy</a>, he met a group of possible future Guardians of the Globe who had searched for him for fifteen years. This team's Robot turned out to be Rex wearing a suit much like the one the Robot clone wore during the Sequid battle.</p><p>Another alternate version of Rex-Splode went by the name Hex Splode, he part of <a href=\"/emperors-elite/4060-56490/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-56490\">Emperor's Elite</a>.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p><strong>Invincible(Amazon series)</strong></p><p>Rex will appear in the series, voiced by Jason Mantzoukas.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105532/", "id": 105532, "name": null, "issue_number": "2"}, "gender": 1, "id": 41137, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/84373-114863-rex-splode.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Main Gallery"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-1001968/", "id": 1001968, "name": "TPB", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-universe-compendium-1-tpb/4000-1001968/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-674061/", "id": 674061, "name": "Volume 12", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-12-volume-12/4000-674061/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-664333/", "id": 664333, "name": "The End of All Things Part Two", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-the-end-of-all-things-2-the-end-of-all-/4000-664333/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-660042/", "id": 660042, "name": "The End of All Things Part Twelve", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-144-the-end-of-all-things-part-twelve/4000-660042/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-508474/", "id": 508474, "name": "Reboot?

As it turns out Robot is really just a machine controlled by the mind of genius Rudy Conners. Rudy was physically unable to live outside of a specially built pod because the air would burn his skin, so he created Robot to live vicariously through. Rudy now exists outside his tube as a clone of <a href=\"/rex-splode/4005-41137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41137\">Rex-Splode</a>, and still controls robot with his mind. There are multiple version of the Robot automation used for different situation.</p><p> </p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><h3>Teen Team</h3><p>Robot was a member of the <a href=\"/teen-team/4060-41090/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41090\">Teen Team</a>, who helped <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a> defeat one of the <a href=\"/mauler-twins/4005-41202/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41202\">Mauler twins</a>. Now much was known about him, other than the fact that he had vast intelligence and some fighting skill. Robot later wiped the Mauler twin's memory and used him to lead himself, <a href=\"/atom-eve/4005-40947/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40947\">Atom Eve</a> and Invincible to the twins' lair, where they apprehended the Mauler twins. Later, Robot was investigating a series of mall bombings and discovered the identity of the bomber, sending Mark and Eve to take down Mr. Hiles, their physics teacher.</p><p> </p><h3>Guardians of the Globe</h3><p> </p><p>With the death of the Guardians of the Globe at the hands of Omni-man, Robot was appointed leader of a new team by <a href=\"/cecil-stedman/4005-42576/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42576\">Cecil Stedman</a> and told to hold trials for new members. The new team was chosen and the new Guardians were underway. Eventually, it became apparent that Robot had feelings for <a href=\"/monster-girl/4005-41162/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41162\">Monster Girl</a> and tried his best to fix her problem. Once <a href=\"/black-samson/4005-41129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41129\">Black Samson</a> was put into a coma by <a href=\"/battle-beast/4005-41126/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41126\">Battle Beast</a>, Robot decided that Monster Girl would use his old suit rather than transforming. After an invasion attempt that the Guardians failed to thwart, Cecil removed Robot from the leadership position and offered it to the <a href=\"/the-immortal/4005-41141/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41141\">Immortal</a>, also bringing <a href=\"/bulletproof/4005-41130/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41130\">Bulletproof</a> into the team.</p><p>Around this time, Rudy secretly used his Robot to take a DNA sample from <a href=\"/rex-splode/4005-41137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41137\">Rex-Splode</a>, having seen how Monster Girl was attracted by his appearance. He enlisted the help of the Mauler twins to help implant his mind into the clone, which was engineered to be younger than Rex, but in the end Rudy ended up as two beings, one mind in the Rex clone and another in the original body. Rudy allowed his original body to die and promptly turned on the Maulers, using his Robot constructs to take them down. By this time Monster Girl had accidentally destroyed Samson's suit and Rudy revealed his true identity to his team. Amanda was pleased that she would finally have someone to hang out with in her down-time, without getting any weird looks, now that Rudy also looked like a kid.</p><p> </p><p>The two went to see movies and went on dates and eventually became very close. They both remained active members of the Guardians of the Globe and Robot continued to try and find a cure for Amanda. They were both chosen to go into space and attempt to stop the <a href=\"/sequids/4060-55695/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55695\">sequid</a> invasion, where Robot was a key player and found a way to disrupt the mental link the sequids shared. He then created a device to separate them from their host, <a href=\"/rus-livingston/4005-55377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55377\">Rus Livingston</a>, allowing the Guardians to bring him safely back to Earth.</p><p> </p><h3>Post Guardians</h3><p> </p><p>After Cecil turned against Invincible, Robot was one of the Guardians to help their friend and leave the government-sanctioned Guardians of the Globe. Along with Monster Girl, Rex-Splode and Bulletproof, Robot set up shop in the old Teen Team base. During that time, Invincible found a device that was monitoring his family and brought it to Robot for analysis, after it self-destructed. The technology was extremely advanced, almost other-wordly, and Rudy was unable to determine who was monitoring Invincible. However, he did make a breakthrough with Monster Girl's condition, creating a belt which would take a copy of her cell structure seconds before each transformation occurred, effectively stopping her de-aging.</p><h3>Invincible War</h3><p>After Rex-Splode's death during the events of Invincible War Rudy had is name legally changed to Rex to honor his friend's sacrifice.</p><p> </p><h3>The Flaxan Dimension</h3><p>When the <a href=\"/flaxans/4060-41165/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41165\">Flaxans</a> retreated after another failed invasion attempt Robot, accompanied by Monster Girl, had followed the Flaxans through the portal to their own dimension in hopes of defeating them for good.</p><p>Almost immediately, they were captured and Imprisoned by the Flaxans after they entered their dimension, but due to how time passed slower for them than for the Flaxans he was able to plan an escape over the course of twenty years. During this time Rex was able to learn the native's language by monitoring radio transmissions. He also learned that the Flaxans planned on enslaving the population of Earth like they had done to several other races and task them to rebuilding their jewel city Klaxia that had been destroyed by Omni-Man centuries before. When their escape, and subsequent attempt on the life of their Emperor failed, Rex and Amanda were charged with rebuilding Klaxia alone as punishment. But seeing the progress that was made the Flaxans eventually began sending in hundreds of slaves to aid them, and as generations passed the slaves rallied behind Rex, which is what he had planned from the beginning, leading them in a revolt against the Empire. As the rebellion escalated other Flaxans began to join the fight against the ruling Zaxal royal family.</p><p>After centuries of war the rebellion was eventually a success and Rex was chosen as the ruler of the Flaxan dimension, and although he and Amanda had the ability to return to Earth, after confessing their love for each other they decided to stay and build a life together on their new home.</p><p>Though they where happy together Rex, burdened by the responsibilities of this rule, began to neglect Monster Girl and their relationship began to weaken for several reasons. When Monster Girl discovered the hash treatment of members of the Zaxal family she began to openly appose his decisions regarding the matter; and after a falling-out she left him, living with the oppressed members of the Zaxal family and their allies for almost two decades. Shortly after she returned their relationship continued to degrade due, in part, to Rex's inability to give Amanda a child.</p><p>When the the twin heirs to the Flaxian throne, Zull and Zall, attempted to overthrow Rex Amanda betrayed him and sided with Zaxals, imprisoning Rex. After years passed Amanda became lonely in Rex's absence, and gave Zall a child through her Monster form, though she was unaware that it was actually possible, but when the twins mounted an attack on another dimension Amanda freed Rex and together they foiled the twin's invasion attempt.</p><p>Though they made amends after this Rex and Amanda decided to return to Earth and try to forget the pain the Flaxan dimension had caused them.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Powers &amp; Abilities</h2><p>Robot a.k.a. Rudy originally was left in a tank which protected his hyper-sensitive skin from the air, however, after his work with the Mauler Twins, he was able to successfully copy his mind into a clone of <a href=\"/rex-splode/4005-41137/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41137\">Rex-Splode</a> although it was a much younger form. He also implanted the same technology used for controlling his suits into said clone so that he could control his automatons without the need of any form of apparatus. Since Rex-Splode's powers are from specially designed surgical implants, Rudy does not possess those powers.</p><p>He told the Mauler Twins that despite being stuck in a tank for much of his life, he did amass a large fortune which was part of what allowed him to become Robot in the first place.</p><p> </p><h2>Other Media</h2><p> </p><h4>Motion Comics</h4><p>Robot is voiced by Stan Kirsch in the motion comic of Invincible.</p><h4><strong>Invincible (Animated Series)</strong></h4><p>Robot appears as a member of the Teen Team, voiced by <a href=\"/zachary-quinto/4040-69718/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-69718\">Zachary Quinto</a></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/11139/111396915/7887176-invi_s1_fg_102_00084921_still073_thumb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7887176\" data-ratio=\"0.56285714285714\" data-width=\"700\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 700px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/a/uploads/original/11139/111396915/7887176-invi_s1_fg_102_00084921_still073_thumb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-7887176\"><img alt=\"Invincible (Amazon series)\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11139/111396915/7887176-invi_s1_fg_102_00084921_still073_thumb.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/11139/111396915/7887176-invi_s1_fg_102_00084921_still073_thumb.jpg 700w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/11139/111396915/7887176-invi_s1_fg_102_00084921_still073_thumb.jpg 480w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/11139/111396915/7887176-invi_s1_fg_102_00084921_still073_thumb.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a><figcaption>Invincible (Amazon series)</figcaption></figure><p> </p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105532/", "id": 105532, "name": null, "issue_number": "2"}, "gender": 1, "id": 41166, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/98959-105564-robot.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Main Gallery"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-1001968/", "id": 1001968, "name": "TPB", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-universe-compendium-1-tpb/4000-1001968/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-677341/", "id": 677341, "name": "Volume 3", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-compendium-3-volume-3/4000-677341/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-674061/", "id": 674061, "name": "Volume 12", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-12-volume-12/4000-674061/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-664333/", "id": 664333, "name": "The End of All Things Part Two", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-the-end-of-all-things-2-the-end-of-all-/4000-664333/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-660042/", "id": 660042, "name": "The End of All Things Part Twelve", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-144-the-end-of-all-things-part-twelve/4000-660042/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-647984/", "id": 647984, "name": "The End of All Things Part Eleven", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-143-the-end-of-all-things-part-eleven/4000-647984/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-638638/", "id": 638638, "name": "The End of All Things Part Ten;

Taking the form of a cheetah allows him to run at speeds of 70mph or assuming the form of a silverback gorilla he can lift roughly 2 tons.</p><h2><b>History </b></h2><p>The chameleonic hero known as The Shapesmith is not only one of the newest heroes of Earth, but he is also one of its newest inhabitants. A shape-shifting Martian, Shapesmith came to Earth after he assumed the form of astronaut <a href=\"/rus-livingston/4005-55377/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-55377\"> Rus Livingston</a> on Mars.</p><p>Livingston and four other astronauts had been captured and sentenced to death by the Martians while on a mission to the red planet. According to the Martian monarch, the mere presence of the \"solid\" humans posed a threat to Martian society due to their susceptibility to being overtaken by the slave race known as <a href=\"/sequids/4060-55695/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55695\"> Sequids</a>.</p><p>At some point during the astronaut's <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\"> Invincible</a>-assisted escape, Shapesmith took Livingston's form and replaced him. A member of a band of rebels who stood against strict Martian society and their enslavement of the Sequids, Shapesmith was convinced by his comrades to replace Rus. As an added bonus to the rebel's plan of freeing the Sequids and overthrowing their corrupt monarch, Shapesmith would have the chance to escape the homeworld he hated.</p><p>Once on Earth, Shapesmith tried unsuccessfully to take over Rus's life. Though he could perfectly mimic the astronauts appearance, he was woefully inept at preforming daily duties. Within a few weeks, Shapesmith had cost Rus his job with NASA and recieved an eviction notice from his landlord. Filled with loneliness and guilt over the havoc he had wreaked in Rus's life, Shapesmith began to doubt his decision to replace the astronaut.</p><p>Just as all hope was lost, Shapesmith found new purpose in life when he saw a television feature about the late hero Martian Man. seeing how his fellow Martian used his natural abilities to fight crime, Shapesmith was reenergized. After studing the appearences and abilities of the Earth's heroes, he chose the name \"Shapesmith\" and embarked on a career of heroics.</p><p>In his first adventure, Shapesmith not only faced the <a href=\"/lizard-league/4060-49628/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-49628\"> Lizard League</a>, but defeated them utterly. Flushed with the success of his first venture, his decision to travel to Earth was seemingly justified. He later assisted the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\"> Guardians of the Globe</a> in apprehending the recently escaped super-criminal <a href=\"/doc-seismic/4005-54718/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54718\"> Doc Seismic</a>. It remains to be seen, however, if Shapesmith's pride will be affected when he learns of the dire consequences of leaving Rus Livingston to be controlled by the Sequids on Mars.</p><h2><strong>Death </strong></h2><p>During <a href=\"/robot/4005-41166/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41166\">Robot</a>'s initial attack on several members of the superhuman society whom he considered a threat to his attempt to create his \"utopia\", Shapesmith was seen to be one of the casualties when one of Robot's new model of drones approaches a badly injured Shapesmith. Shapesmith attempts to plead with Robot, stating that he thought that Robot was his friend. Robot proceeds to reply that the attack was nothing personal, before crushing Shapesmith's core, killing him.</p><h2><b>Known superpowers </b></h2><p>Like all Martians, Shapesmith is a metamorph. He is capable of psionically shifting atoms and molecules of his body and whatever clothing he is wearing so as to change his and its appearances. As a result he can cause himself to look and sound like an exact duplicate of any human, humanoid, semi-humanoid or non-humanoid being of either sex, wearing virtually any kind of clothing. His control is so exact that he can precisely duplicate another person's retinal pattern in his own eyes, finger, skin and pore patterns on his own hands and skin, and vocal cords to match voices to the point of corresponding voiceprints.</p><p>He can gain the natural physical attributes, including the strength, speed, reflexes and senses of the beings or creatures whose forms he assumes. Shapesmith can not , however, gain the extra-sensory or superhuman abilities of the imitated form. He is able to combine the DNA of various previously-imitated organisims to form composite creatures. He is able to add and subtract an unknown amount of physical mass to his body when assuming shapes larger or smaller than his own natural Martian form. It is theorized he is able to draw the extra mass from a store of the ambient quantum material around him and return it back again after his reverted back to his natural form.</p><p>Like all Martians in the Invincible universe, Shapesmith has a \"core\", which can cause his death if damaged.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url":

Regardless, investigative reporters from the superhero gossip TV program Unmasked have published a widely-believed theory as to Shrinking Ray's identity and how he recieved his powers.</p><p>It is thought that Ray was employed by microrganics Ltd. in Bethesda, Maryland at the time of the fatal implosion that destroyed the company's nanotechnology lab. One of the survivors was an intern named Ray, who has not been located since the implosion. The Unmasked reporters advanced the theory that Ray gained the ability to change his size at will from the microrganics accident and shortly thereafter became a superhero. Shrinking Ray has refused to confirm or deny the story.</p><p>Shrinking Ray first gained national attention when he saved the life of the Lieutenant Governor of Vermont from a microscopic assassin who had gained access to his brain. Ray defeated the killer in a sub-atomic duel inside the politicain's skull. Over the next several years, Shrinking Ray fought evil of all sizes, oftern toiling in obscurity. Eventually Ray did establish a solid reputation with high-profile battles against menaces like killipede, mindwyrm, and his arch-enemies The Legion of Miniature Assassins.</p><p>Shrinking Ray was admitted into the new Guardians of the Glode, where he has served with distinction. Ray is sensitive to the fact that his powers are not as spectacular as those his teammates possess, and deeply resents any inplication that his shrinking abilities are not useful. Shrinking Ray's insecurities just inspire him to greater acts of heroism. Through hard work and unswerving devotion to the Guardians, perhaps some day this small crime fighter will be considered a giant among heroes.</p><h2>In Other Media</h2><p><strong>Invincible (Amazon series)</strong></p><p>A female version of the hero appears, renamed <strong>Shrinking Rae. </strong> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105539/", "id": 105539, "name": "Perfect Strangers, Part 1", "issue_number": "9"}, "gender": 1, "id": 42575, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/99142-171797-shrinking-ray.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Ray"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-508474/", "id": 508474, "name": "Reboot?

Though the race is incredibly weak the make up for it by inventing the Tech Jacket, a machine vest that every Geldarian is equipped with upon birth. Seeing Zack and knowing his crashed spaceship is going to blow up and kill them both he gives him the Tech Jacket therefore sparing his life.</p><p>After saving his father from some mobsters Zach tells him about the crashed spaceship and dying alien. The pair agree to keep the Tech Jacket (and the mobsters) a secret from Zack's mom. Some time later the Geldarians show up thinking he killed Kresh (the alien) and stole the Tech Jacket. The Kresh arrive seeking revenge as well and Zack proves to the Geldarians not only that he didn't steal the suit but that he is a true hero by helping them fend of their enemies. Zack is taken to Geldarian Space and learns how to properly use the Tech Jacket. He also learns that removal is not allowed due to <i>executive decree 574-3 (Zack is later told that he might not survive the removal process anyways).</i></p><p>After the defeat of the Kresh Zack returns to earth to find his home &amp; father's business abandoned. The mobsters return and Zack orders them to take him to their boss.</p><p>After threatening to kill them, all the mobsters agree to never have any more dealings with the Thompson family. Zack is later reunited with his parents.</p><h3>Image Universe</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1372363-1372319_inv_074_0013_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1372363\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.67692307692308\" data-width=\"585\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 585px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.7%\" href=\"https://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/5/58664/1372363-1372319_inv_074_0013_super.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1372363\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/58664/1372363-1372319_inv_074_0013_super.jpg\" srcset=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/5/58664/1372363-1372319_inv_074_0013_super.jpg 585w, https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/5/58664/1372363-1372319_inv_074_0013_super.jpg 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px\" data-width=\"480\"></a></figure><p>Despite the series being cut off early, Tech Jacket has appeared through many other <a href=\"/kirkmanverse/4015-49604/\" data-ref-id=\"4015-49604\">Image comics</a>, specifically <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invi</a><a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">ncible</a>, another one of <a href=\"/robert-kirkman/4040-40977/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40977\">Kirkman's</a> characters.

member of the Guardians of the Globe. He was the only member to survive Omni-Man's slaughter of the original team.", "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Immortal has been around for many, many years. He is older than the legend of King Arthur, serving as one of his legendary knights. He discovered North America, and fought in the Revolution for the revolutionaries. He even served as President under the alias of Abraham Lincoln. Later, he became a superhero and a member of the original <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">Guardians of the Globe</a>.</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>The Immortal was created by <a href=\"/robert-kirkman/4040-40977/\" data-ref-id=\"4040-40977\">Robert Kirkman</a>, his first appearance was in Invincible #7.</p><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>The Immortal was seemingly killed by <a href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\">Omni-Man</a> along with the rest of the Guardians of the Globe but lived up to his name when it was revealed that he survived (despite having been decapitated). He was revived by the Mauler twins, who, while reattaching his head, attempted to use a 'control beacon' to make him their slave. It did not work. The Immortal shortly thereafter survived being killed by Omni-Man a second time, this time being impaled through the abdomen and ripped in half. After the new version of the Guardians of the Globe failed to meet expectations, Immortal was brought in as a \"consultant\" for Robot, the team's leader, and when the team continued to underperform, Immortal was appointed the full-fledged leader in hopes of turning them around. The Immortal was married to his teenage teammate <a href=\"/dupli-kate/4005-41136/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41136\">Dupli-Kate</a> until her apparent death in Invincible #40 were she was killed in a battle with the Lizard League. Immortal in his grief would later attack Allen the Alien for almost no reason and left the team after he realized he was taking Kate's death too hard. It was later revealed that the Kate that died was another duplicate, and the Immortal began a relationship with the original Dupli-Kate.</p><p>After the Invincibles from other dimensions came to our earth and caused massive destruction Immortal was killed but after he was brought back he decided to retire along with Kate and start a family.</p><p>It was revealed that at one point, Invincible will leave Earth and leave the Immortal in charge. In doing so however, the Immortal grew distant from humanity and ruled the planet with an iron fist. Invincible was taken to the future by two twins to put an end of the Immortal's rule. He succeeded and told the twins to keep his various body parts in storage to keep them from being brought back together. The timeline has since changed since Mark is aware of this future now.</p><h2>Character Information</h2><p><b> Real name:</b> Unrevealed</p><p><b>Occupation:</b> Adventurer</p><p><b>Identity:</b> Secret</p><p><b>Legal status:</b> Citizenship currently unknown</p><p><b>Former aliases:</b> Abraham Lincoln</p><p><b>Place of birth:</b> Europe</p><p><b>Marital status: </b>Widowed, hundreds of times</p><p><b>Known relatives:</b> None</p><p><b>Group affiliations: </b>The Guardians of the Globe</p><p><b>Base of operations:</b> The Guardians of the Globe Headquarters, Utah</p><p><b>Height:</b> 6' 4\"</p><p><b>Weight:</b> 260 lbs</p><p><b>Hair:</b> Black</p><p><b>Eyes:</b> Blue</p><p><b>Strength level:</b> The Immortal possesses superhuman strength. He can lift (press) at least 100 tons directly overhead. He can hurl a person into orbit around the earth or hit a <a href=\"https://comicvine.gamespot.com/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\">Viltrumite</a> hard enough to actually give the alien being pause.</p><h2>Powers/Abilities</h2><p>The Immortal gained the power of \"everlasting life\" at some point in the distant past through as yet unknown means. His exact age is uncertain but is believed to be well over 3,000 years old. He does not age, is not susceptible to disease, has exceptional recuperative powers, almost inexhaustible endurance, limitless stamina and is invulnerable to conventional forms of harm. His flesh, while feeling much like human flesh, is capable of withstanding temperature and pressure extremes as well as concussive forces up to those of an anti-tank missile. Should the Immortal somehow be injured, he could regenerate any damaged or missing tissue. He can regrow organs and limbs in days. His head has been removed from his torso, severing his vertebrae in two, and on another occasion his upper and lower torso have been torn in half, again resulting the severing of his spinal cord. On both occasions the Immortal has fully recovered within days of the incidents. The Immortal could only die through an injury that disperses a significant portion of his body's molecules.</p><p>The Immortal is able to mentally manipulate graviton particles around himself to achieve the enviable gift of unaided flight. His top flight speed is currently unknown, but it is sufficient for him to reach escape velocity (33 times the speed of sound: 25,000 miles per hour) within seconds. The Immortal's reflexes and perceptions are enhanced in direct proportion to his movement speed, allowing him to perform complex high-velocity maneuvers with ease.</p><p>The Immortal retains the knowledge he has accumulated throughout his millennia's long lifespan and accordingly is a formidable tactician and strategist with a hundred lifetimes of experience to draw upon.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105537/", "id": 105537, "name": null, "issue_number": "7"}, "gender": 1, "id": 41141, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/84364-11652-the-immortal.jpg", "image_tags": "Aeamons Deciples,All Images,Gallery"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-674061/", "id": 674061, "name": "Volume 12", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-12-volume-12/4000-674061/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-664333/", "id": 664333, "name": "The End of All Things Part Two", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-the-end-of-all-things-2-the-end-of-all-/4000-664333/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-660042/", "id": 660042, "name": "The End of All Things Part Twelve", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-144-the-end-of-all-things-part-twelve/4000-660042/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-647984/", "id": 647984, "name": "The End of All Things Part Eleven", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-143-the-end-of-all-things-part-eleven/4000-647984/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-638638/", "id": 638638, "name": "The End of All Things Part Ten; Robot War!", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-142-the-end-of-all-things-part-ten-robo/4000-638638/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-589852/", "id": 589852, "name": "Volume Twenty-Three", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-full-house-1-volume-twenty-three/4000-589852/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-546076/", "id": 546076, "name": "", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-130/4000-546076/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-530757/", "id": 530757, "name": "", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-128/4000-530757/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-508474/", "id": 508474, "name": "Reboot?
