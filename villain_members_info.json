His race is part of the Coalition of Planets.", "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>The Leonine extra-terrestrial Battle Beast claims to have conquered a thousand worlds and that galactic empires tremble at the sound of his name. These boasts remain unverified, but given his might, could well be true. He lives for the fight, viewing personal combat as sport, seeking to test himself against worthy adversaries, which, given his power levels, are few and far between. When he encounters a meritorious foe Battle Beast likes to claim a trophy from them, usually their decapitated head.</p><p>Battle Beast recently visited Earth, having been informed by unspecified parties that it would provide him fierce and challenging opponents. Under undisclosed circumstances he was employed by the crimelord <a href=\"/machine-head/4005-4731/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4731\">Machine Head</a> as an enforcer and bodyguard. When <a href=\"/titan/4005-4729/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-4729\">Titan</a> and <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a> invaded Machine Head's headquarters, Battle Beast was amongst the hirelings ordered to stop them. Battle Beast claimed to be mildly impressed by Invincible's strength, but still easily overpowered him. The arrival of the <a href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\">Guardians of the Globe</a> seconds later may well have spared Invincible's life, while the rest of the Guardians easily defeated Battle Beast's fellow villains, <a href=\"/bulletproof/4005-41130/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41130\">Bulletproof</a> and <a href=\"/black-samson/4005-41129/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41129\">Black Samson</a> double-teamed the alien menace. Neither proved a match for him, and within seconds he left both men severely injured. Announcing to the rest of the heroes that he could not be bothered to kill them all as they were no contest, and angrily proclaiming Earth had nothing to offer him by way of real sport, Battle Beast angrily teleported away.</p><p>Since Battle Beast departed Earth, he, or another similar member of his species, has been seen sitting on the council of the <a href=\"/coalition-of-planets/4060-41132/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-41132\">Coalition of Planets</a>. Given that the Coalition are seeking ways to oppose the growing threat of the <a href=\"/viltrumites/4060-54662/\" data-ref-id=\"4060-54662\">Viltrumites</a>, and Battle Beast's desire to test himself in combat, perhaps Battle Beast has offered his services to the Coalition in hope of finally finding worthy foes. He is later seen in captivity with the Viltrumites who have been sent to execute Nolan. There he, Allen the Alien and Nolan stage a breakout, though Battle Beast is solely in it for the joy of the battle and not any altruistic tendencies. During this battle he is able to fight an adult Viltrumite to a standstill and is implied to be superior.</p><p>When recruiting superpowered individuals to fight against the Viltrumite Empire, Invincible and Nolan learned that Battle Beast was a messiah figure to his people. He turned their planet into a utopia, but the violence required made him addicted to it. He went into outer space to satisfy his thirst for battle. His people still hope for his return.</p><p>He was eventually recruited by the Coalition of Plants to fight in the Viltrumite War. He was constantly on the front lines barely accepting help from anyone. He participated in the assault on the Viltrumite homeworld where he killed several Viltrumites. However, when he attacked <a href=\"https://www.comicvine.com/grand-regent-thragg/4005-72505/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-72505\">Grand Regent Thragg</a> he was quickly overpowered and his neck broken. It is unknown if he survived.</p><h2>Character Information</h2><ul><li><strong>Real name</strong>: Unrevealed</li><li><b>Occupation: </b>World conqueror, hunter</li><li><b>Identity: </b>Existence unknown to the general population of Earth</li><li><b>Legal status: </b>Wanted by U.S. authorities</li><li><b>Former aliases: </b>Scourge of Twin Galaxies</li><li><b>Place of birth: </b>Unrevealed</li><li><b>Marital status: </b>Unrevealed</li><li><b>Known relatives: </b>None</li><li><b>Group affiliations: </b>Machine Head (bodyguard)</li><li><b>Base of operations: </b>Unknown</li><li><b>Height: </b>7' 6\"</li><li><b>Weight: </b>775 lbs</li><li><b>Eyes: </b>Blue</li><li><b>Hair: </b>White</li><li><b>Strength level: </b>Battle Beast possesses superhuman strength allowing him to lift over 50 tons and possibly more.</li></ul><h2>Known Superpowers</h2><p>Battle Beast is a superbly trained warrior and highly skilled hunter, whose abilities have been honed to the peak of perfection. He has attained nearly unparalleled proficiency in the use of all known hand wielded weapons and combat apparatus. His mastery of all known fighting systems and his own unique hand to hand armed combat styles combined with is unlimited endurance, physical prowess and high resistance to injury make Battle Beast one of the most formidable opponents in the known universe. His senses are highly acute. His vision is superior at nigh in comparison to humans, allowing him to see clearly in near total darkness. His visual acuity in normal light allows him to see at 80 feet what most humans can see at 10 feet. His hearing is so sensitive that he can clearly hear changes in acoustic pressure of -10 decibels (where as a the human hearing range is from 20 dB to 140 dB). Battle Beast can detect the tiniest variances in sound, distinguishing differences of as little as one-tenth of a tone. He can hear sounds at great distances, four to five times farther away than humans. His sense of smell is about 14 times stronger than a human's Battle Beast's whiskers (technically called vibrissae) can aid with navigation and sensation. His whiskers detect very small shifts in air current enabling him to know he is near obstructions without actually seeing them. Like similar large predatory feline mammals, he can deliver a lethal neck bite with his long canine teeth that severs the victim's spinal cord, or asphyxiate it by crushing the windpipe.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p>Battle Beast makes use of a variety of weapons. He frequently employs heavy bladed weapons and swords as well as large flanged maces, cudgels and quarter staffs.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url":

Over the years Bi-Plane continually upgraded his uranium powered wings in order to carry out daring aerial crimes such as hijacking a postal service cargo plane, robbing a hot air balloon regatta and attacking Air Force Two.<br />Bi-Plane's clashes with costumed heroes frequently ended in incarceration or injury, and as he aged Bi-Plane found he spent more time as an inmate than as a villian. A prison doctor told Bi-Plane that decades of wearing a poorly shielded uranium powered jet on his back had taken their toll in addition to pinched nerves and a herniated disc, Bi-Plane was dying of cancer.<br />Bitter and vengeful, Bi-Plane escaped from a federal penitentiary in Colorado and donned his flying wings for one last act of spite against the world. Unhinged with despair, the dying Bi-Plane planned to detonate his flying machine high over Denver, showering the city with radiation.<br />Fortunately, the super-strong hero <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41141\" href=\"/the-immortal/4005-41141/\">The Immortal</a> intervened and physically threw Bi-Plane into outer space before he could detonate the apparatus. Today Bi-Plane's desiccated body floats high in orbit on an endless, silent flight.<br /><br /><br /><b></b><h2><b>Weapons and Abilities</b></h2><b></b><b>Abilities:</b>Bi-Plane was a brilliant avionics engineer with great talent for invention.<br /><b>Weapon</b>s:Bi-Plane was capable of flying by utilizing a uranium powered ultra light fixed-wing flying harness similar in design to traditional biplane aircraft, Constructed of light weight materials such as aluminum, graphite composites and high strength plastics. The flying rig consisted of two main wings of similar spans, one mounted above the other, the upper wing overlapping the lower wing in a forward staggered configuration, designed to minimize aerodynamic interference between the two wings. Vertical and slightly raked support struts, positioned symmetrically on either side of the engin block, connected the rigid sections of the upper and lower wings into a strong box structure.<br />Coming from a time before Smart Atoms that is before the arrival of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-40550\" href=\"/omni-man/4005-40550/\">Omni-Man</a> on Earth, Bi-Plane was forced to use a dangerously radioactive uranium powered jet turbine positioned between the wings to provide thrust for his airframe. Bi-Plane was able to take off from a stand still by jumping into the air while at the same time engaging the tubine on his back. He could attain a maximum level flight speed of 340 knots utilizing special breathing apparatus but generally kept his cruising speeds below 104 knots the limit at which he could breath normally. His maximum rate of climb at sea level was 3000 ft/min. He was able to reach a maximum altitude of 25,000 feet with the aid external breathing apparatus but preferred to cruise at or below 11,000 feet which eliminated the need for an external oxygen supply. Bi-Plane was capable of preforming complex aerobatic maneuvers including spins, dives, loop-the loops and barrel roll maneuvers. The double wing design of the harness provided sufficient lift to enable him to carry over 300 lbs. In adition to his own weight while flying. He wore a special flight suit of his own design which allowed him to withstand the rigors and temperature extremes of jet powered atmospheric flight.", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105537/", "id": 105537, "name": null, "issue_number": "7"}, "gender": 1, "id": 41128, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/0/308/84150-152919-bi-plane.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Bi-Plane"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-419243/", "id": 419243, "name": "", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/neuyazvimiy-13/4000-419243/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-371271/", "id": 371271, "name": "Volume 1", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-compendium-1-volume-1/4000-371271/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-176004/", "id": 176004, "name": "TPB", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-official-handbook-of-the-invincible-universe-1/4000-176004/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-412393/", "id": 412393, "name": "Vol. 1", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/the-complete-invincible-library-1-vol-1/4000-412393/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-134089/", "id": 134089, "name": "A-L -

He is super strong and has perfect memory, but he isn't very smart.", "description": "<h2>Character Information</h2><p><b>Height</b>: 6' 4\" (in suit 6' 7\")</p><p><b>Weight</b>: 460 lbs (in suit 610 lbs)</p><p><b>Eyes</b>: Brown</p><p><b>Hair</b>: Unknown</p><p><b>Strength level:</b> The Elephant possesses superhuman strength allowing him to lift 15 tons under optimal conditions. </p><h2>History </h2><p>Little is known of the past of the super-criminal known as Elephant. The process by which he became super-strong and how his synthetic hide became bonded to his flesh are still a mystery. Due either to a natural criminal inclination or an inability to live normally in society, Elephant turned to a life of crime. Over the years he took part in many crimes as an individual, a henchmen or a partner. During one such criminal venture, Elephant was confronted by <a href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\">Invincible</a>. The new hero made quick work of the villain despite boasts about his toughness. Incapacitated after his battel with Invincible, Elephant was taken to the federal penitentiary for super powered criminals. He remains incarcerated there and has been seeing using his free time for reading.</p><h3> </h3><h2>Powers and Equipment</h2><p>The chemical structures of the Elephant's Physiological make-up have been altered by unknown means granting him enhanced physical strength and denser body mass, a higher degree of resistance to physical injury, increased stamina and accelerated recuperative powers. It has been speculated that the Elephant also possesses a photographic or eidetic memory, also referred to as total recall, which is the ability to recall images, sounds or objects in memory with great accuracy and in seemingly unlimited volume. Unfortunately the Elephant possesses a low to below average intellect and has yet to apply his augmented memory abilities in a manner that could aid him in his criminal endeavors. </p><h3><u> <b>Uniform:</b></u></h3><p> The Elephant is clad in a thickly cast, synthesized polymer hide that is similar to an elephant's skin that exhibits a material property called \"strain rate sensitivity\". Under normal conditions the molecules within the material are weakly bound and can move past each other with ease, making the material flexible. But the shock of sudden deformation causes the chemical bonds to strengthen and the moving molecules to lock, turning the material into a more solid, protective shield. It cover's his entire body except for his face, and has a small sealable seam through which he can eliminate waste. It is highly impervious to damage, able to resist explosions equaling the impact of a small anti-tank weaponry and temperature extremes between 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 1,200 degrees fahrenheit.

Originally a hero turned supervillian, but has since learned the error of his ways and is trying to redeem himself, but knows that he can never return to earth.", "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>The super-being known to the people of Earth as Omni-Man is not actually human, but a member of the alien Viltrumite race. Extreamly powerful by human standards, the Viltrumites are a brutal, vicious race. They achieved a what they term a utopia by culling the weaker from their own numbers, leaving a race of conquerors bent on bringing new worlds under their control, subjugating weaker civilizations. Races who failed to submit to the Viltrumites were attacked and in some cases wiped from existance.</p><p>Nolan had pursued greatness among the Viltrumites, working arduously to earn a position on the conquering committee. He was stationed on the frontier of the expanding empire, helping conquer numerous worlds, as well as undertaking solo missions such as hunting down the \"infinity ray\" weapon. Excelling at his work, Nolan received accolades for his brutality and efficiency and was soon promoted to lead his own division.</p><p>Omni-Man is a <a href=\"../../viltrumites/65-54662/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Viltrumite</a> sent to Earth to conquer it, but started a family instead. He married a woman he saved and had a son, Mark Grayson, <a href=\"../../invincible/29-5210/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Invincible</a>. Knowing that his wife and son would not accept him for who he really was and what his real reasons for coming to earth were, he changed his story from one of conquest to one of peace bringer.</p><p>Omni-Man, going by the name Nolan Grayson, became an author to make money and when he wasn't writing, he was protecting the planet as Omni-Man with the aid of a government official named <a href=\"../../cecil/29-55964/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Cecil</a>. After he had learned his son Mark, had developed his super powers, he helped Mark understand how to use these new powers and the told him that he would get stronger but only by pushing himself physically. Omni-Man and Invincible at times also worked together.</p><p>Omni-Man knowing that he had strayed from his goals set in motion the plan of weakening earths defenses by killing former friends The <a href=\"../../guardians-of-the-globe/65-41091/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Guardians of the Globe</a>. Do to the work of GG's enemies, the member of Guardians of the Globe <a href=\"../../the-immortal/29-41141/\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Immortal</a> was brought back to life with the intent of controlling him. He did not fall under there control though and proceeded to go after Omni-Man intent on revenge. Mark arrived to help his father with a rescue only to arrive just as he killed Immortal for the second time. Omni-Man proceeded to tell Mark the truth of his past and why he had been sent to Earth. Mark would not believe that his father was a cold blooded killer and confronted him instead, not willing to join in part of conquering or destroying earth.</p><p>They fought and Omni-Man beat his son nearly to death. Seemingly unable to kill his own son he left the planet, and started another family on another world. He contacted his son some time later and invited him to the planet where he was living. There he revealed that he had another son, for on this planet the beings that lived there grew much faster, so in the few months he was away he had had a child that was now a toddler. It was at this point that several other Viltrumites appeared and attempted to capture Omni-Man. Mark was forced to leave (taking his half brother back to Earth with him) and abandon his father who is currently a prisoner of the Viltrumites, his own people. The last thing Omni-Man said to his son was, \"Read my books.\" When Mark was teaching his half brother how to fly, on Earth, he had to explain to him that everyone on Earth hated Omni-Man, but he didn't belive it.</p><p>While in Prison, Allen the Alien (who had gotten himself incarcerated) hatched an escape plan with Omni-man. On the day his execution was to be carried out Allen busted himself free and also freed the Battle beast along with Omni-Man they killed the two Viltrumite excutioners.</p><h2>Preparations for the Viltrumite war</h2><p>In this two issue mini with artist Cory Walker, Kirkman focuses on Allen, and Nolan. Allen and Nolan have just escaped from the Viltrumite prison in which they were being held captive. Their primary focus is going to certain parts of the universe, and finding things that can hurt the Viltrumites. Nolan (having been on many adventures himself) knows what can hurt them. It is also noted that there was a virus produced by rebels of the Viltrumite empire which was successful in killing a large number of them and in turn leaving an extremely small population of Viltrumites alive. It seems the reason they need to inhabit earth is because they can successfully re-breed their population there.</p><p>Nolan's novels are are actually brought to life when Allen discovers that the Space Racer (a man Nolan supposedly killed) is still alive. He has a special type of weapon that returns to him automatically when touched by other individual. Nolan and Allen try to save him by digging him out of the rubble. Finally the Space Race is exposed and tries to kill Nolan. When Space Racer tries to kill Nolan, Nolan explains that he has switched sides. Space Racer doesn't believe him at first, but Allen then reassures him and he agrees to play a role in the upcoming war.</p><p>He then returns to Earth searching for his son and Tech Jacket. After finally founding them both, he decided to bring Oliver too this mission also. In the middle of the vastness of space they all get attack by Conquest.</p><h2>Powers</h2><p>We know that Nolan is the comic's version of Superman and like the Man of Steel, he's from another world. He's ridiculously strong, fast, durable, and can fly. Nolan's ability to heal from injuries comes in handy when taking on other Viltrumites such as Thragg, Anissa, and the others. The former superhero has some very strong DNA inside him, the dude can override the genetics of whoever he produces an child with (explaining why Oliver looks so much like him). His power to fly can get him travelling through outer space in a matter of seconds. Being in space and stuff, he can hold his breath for as long as two weeks in order to remain active. Nolan's a pretty good fighter, judging by what he did to his son and a few other enemies of his, you DO NOT want to get on his bad side.</p><p><b>Super-strength:</b> Omni-Man possesses the vast superhuman strength of a Viltrum male of his size, stature and age. He can lift in excess of 1,000,000,000 tons, his upper limits are unknown although he has been shown to be able to match Mean Supreme in strength.</p><p><b>Flight:</b> It is speculated that Omni-Man flies by means of manipulating gravitons thereby negating the force of gravity, enabling him to fly at speeds rivaling starships. While in earth he usually moves at Mach speeds, but outside the atmosphere he can easily move massively faster than light.</p><p><b>Invulnerability:</b> His skin is capable to withstand great heat without blistering, great cold without freezing, and great impact without injury, with the assistance of Invincible and Thaedus he was able to destroy planet Viltrum by flying through it.</p><p><b>Self Sustenance:</b> Can survive long periods (weeks) without food, water or rest. He can survive unprotected in the vacuum of space or at the deepest ocean depths for as long as he is capable of holding his breath. Omni-Man has stated that on at least two accasions, he held his breath for as long as two weeks with only one gulp of air in his lungs.</p><p><b>Reflexes:</b> At least on subliminal speed as he is able to navigate and process information even while travelling at high speeds.</p><p><b>Healing:</b> He has exceptional recuperative powers, endurance and is highly resistant to most conventional froms of injury, on the off chance something can hurt him is Viltrum physiology allows him to recover from physical damage at an extremely accelerated rate.</p><p><b>Extended Lifespan:</b> The Viltrum have exremely long life spans and Nolan has indicated that he has lived well over two millennia as time is measured on Earth.</p><h2>Personal Info</h2><p><b>Past Occupations:</b> Adventurer, world conqueror, superhero, author</p><p><b>Current Occupation:</b> Member of the Coalition of Planets, protector of the universe</p><p><b>Identity Status:</b> Nolan's family knows of his alien identity Noolan, superheroes of the earth know him as Nolan Grayson, the public knows him as Omni-Man</p><p><b>Legal status:</b> Citizen of Viltrum, now traitor, citizen of the U.S, now fugitive.</p><p><b>Place of birth:</b> Viltrum</p><p><b>Marital status:</b> Widow, divorced</p><p><b>Known relatives:</b> Andressa (mate, deceased), Deborah Grayson (ex-wife.former widow, current girlfriend), Mark Grayson (son), Oliver (son)</p><p><b>Group affiliations:</b> Formerly Guardians of the Globe ally (never a member), Coalition of Planets.</p><p><b>Base of operation:</b> Formerly Viltrum, and Mantis world.

man who worked his way to the top of the criminal ladder from the bottom, Titan is the leader of a super-villain mob.", "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>The superhuman gangster Titan's story is a warped reflection of the American dream. From humble beginnings, Titan clawed his way up the criminal hierarchy until he became the leader of a powerful criminal cartel. Although Titan has super-strength and a rocky hide, he owes his meteoric rise more to his ambition and cunning then physical force.</p><p>Aside from his extensive criminal record, little is known about Titan. At some point the ambitious young street criminal caught the attention of the gang lord <a data-ref-id=\"4005-4731\" href=\"/machine-head/4005-4731/\" slug=\"machine-head\">Machine Head</a>, who made Titan a member of his crew.</p><p>For years, Titan performed Machine Head's dirty work, earning the gangster's trust while plotting his demise. One night Titan lured Machine Head into a city park and sprung his trap. The immensely strong Titan beat Machine Head severely and would have killed him were it not for the timely intervention of a band of proessional heroes from <a data-ref-id=\"4060-55235\" href=\"/capes-inc/4060-55235/\" slug=\"capes-inc\">Capes Inc</a>. Titan escaped, but he had squandered his one chance at eliminating Machine Head.</p><p>Cast out and on the run from Machine Head's killers, Titan still klung to his dream of criminal supremacy. Working with a traitor within Machine Head's gang, Titan devised a new plan to depose the king of the underworld.</p><p>Titan gained the trust of <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5210\" href=\"/invincible/4005-5210/\" slug=\"invincible\">Invincible</a>, with the intention of manipulating the young hero into conflict with the cadre of superhuman bodyguards that the now cautious Machine Head surrounded himself with. Titan convinced Invincible that, although he had not reformed, he sincerly wanted to bring Machine Head to justice. Together Invincible and Titan burst into Machine Heads office and battled his superhuman bodyguards: <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42570\" href=\"/kursk/4005-42570/\" slug=\"kursk\">Kursk</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55128\" href=\"/tether-tyrant/4005-55128/\" slug=\"tether-tyrant\">Tether Tyrant</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41163\" href=\"/furnace/4005-41163/\" slug=\"furnace\">Furnace</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55127\" href=\"/magmaniac/4005-55127/\" slug=\"magmaniac\">Magmaniac</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"4005-42571\" href=\"/magnattack/4005-42571/\" slug=\"magnattack\">Magnattack</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41126\" href=\"/battle-beast/4005-41126/\" slug=\"battle-beast\">Battle Beast</a>. The new <a data-ref-id=\"4060-41091\" href=\"/guardians-of-the-globe/4060-41091/\" slug=\"guardians-of-the-globe\">Guardians of the Globe</a> joined and the heroes ultimately won, but at a cost; the alien Battle Beast mauled Invincible and <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41130\" href=\"/bulletproof/4005-41130/\" slug=\"bulletproof\">Bulletproof</a> and severely injured <a data-ref-id=\"4005-41129\" href=\"/black-samson/4005-41129/\" slug=\"black-samson\">Black Samson</a>, who slipped into a coma. During the fight, Machine Head's teleporting major domo <a data-ref-id=\"4005-55126\" href=\"/isotope/4005-55126/\" slug=\"isotope\">Isotope</a> vanished when his boss needed him most, and the gangster was found under his desk.</p><p>Invincible and the Guardians seemed satisfied that Machine Head's criminal empire had been decapitated, but in the shadows, aided by the traitorous Isotope, Titan seized control of the underword empire. Titan's ambition and drive have payed off; now he secretly controls the largest criminal organisation on the north American continent. Titan for some months had been at war with Mr. Liu of the Order until they were both defeated by Invincible. Titan was brought back in by Set, the leader of the Order and was told that he would work with him or be killed. Eventually, Titan, Machine Head and Mr. Liu had to once again work together to stay within Set's plans for world destruction. However, following the destruction of Paris, Set was unmasked and his gaze immobilized both the Order and the Guardians of the Globe for up to two hours. When Titan and Isotope recovered, Titan returned to rebuild his empire as the Order was left unbalanced. Using both Furnace and Tether Tyrant as his main enforcers, things went wrong when the Guardians of the Globe attacked and Furnace was killed and Tether Tyrant bonded his symboite and went insane before <a data-ref-id=\"4005-5212\" href=\"/brit/4005-5212/\" slug=\"brit\">Brit</a> defeated him.</p><h2>Character Information</h2><h3>Human Form Titan Form</h3><p><strong>Height:</strong> 6' 2\" <strong>Height:</strong> 6' 3\"</p><p><strong>Weight:</strong> 250 lbs <strong>Weight:</strong> 1,450 lbs</p><p><strong>Eyes:</strong> Brown <strong>Eyes:</strong> Not visible</p><p><strong>Hair:</strong> Black <strong>Hair:</strong> None</p><p><b>Strength leve</b>l: While encased in his rock like form, Titan possesses superhuman strength allowing him to lift up to 20 tons.</p><p>When in his human form he has the normal strength of a man his age, height and build who engages in intensive regular exercise.</p><h2>Known superpowers</h2><p>Titan is capable of generating a stone like outer shell, closely resembling granite which encases his entire body from head to toe, by force of will. while in his stone like state, he retains his normal human reflexes, speed and mobility while gaining all the physical properties of stone such as strength and hardness, this provides him superhuman resistance to impact damage, temperature and pressure extremes. He is capable of withstanding the impact of small arms fire at a distance of at least 10 feet with minimal damage to his outer husk. The thickness of his stone outer skin ranges from half an inche at its thinest to 1 inche at its thickest. His initial trasformation leaves Titan enclosed in a solid sheath of stone with no visible points of articulation or seams. Articulation is achieved after he moves within his stone husk, cracking the shell at joints and points of flexion (knee or elbow). Titan does not possesses the ability to repair his outer husk if it is damaged, cracked or chipped and must shed the shell entirely in order to generate a new, pristine one to replace it. Despite his weight and mass, Titan is capable of preforming a standing high jump of up to 10 feet.</p>", "first_appeared_in_issue": {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/first_appeared_in_issue/4000-105347/", "id": 105347, "name": null, "issue_number": "1"}, "gender": 1, "id": 4729, "image": {"icon_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "medium_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "screen_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "small_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "super_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_large/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_mini/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "original_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1/15659/2707378-titan_invincible_torn_suit.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Gallery"}, "issue_credits": [{"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-793236/", "id": 793236, "name": null, "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-1-free-comic-book-day-1/4000-793236/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-595723/", "id": 595723, "name": "Volume 11", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-ultimate-collection-11-volume-11/4000-595723/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-516116/", "id": 516116, "name": "Reboot?", "site_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/invincible-reboot-1-reboot/4000-516116/"}, {"api_detail_url": "https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/issue/4000-503588/", "id": 503588, "name": "Reboot?
